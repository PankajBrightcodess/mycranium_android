For reference, doctors could earn 30k-40k rupees (about 480-640 USD) from referring patients for angioplasty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way medical professionals can get money from referring patients is by referring patients from government hospitals to private. By intentionally damaging assets or instruments in a government hospital, thereby making them unavailable to patients, forcing them to order from a private hospital, in which profits are split.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors who have access to drugs and other instruments also tend to use them for personal gain. Doctors steal these things to sell them off for profits. Another way these drugs are misused is by alternative medical practitioners, who are not even allowed to use modern drugs, who use them anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is understaffed when it comes to medical professionals, and its facilities are dysfunctional. For some doctors, they feel that corruption is the only way they could survive. Young doctors who have just received an education, are usually in debt and require the money they receive from malpractice to pay these debts off. It is also common for doctors to earn less than 10k USD a year, showing how much they find malpractice necessary for survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another big issue is the lack of regulation. Many regions in India do not enforce medical regulation laws, leading to the patients suffering. Some hospitals also pay bribes to the government to be in favor of the law and not be punished for not following regulations, which are usually not enforced anyways.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1637825488.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'corruption-within-indias-public-health-system', '', '2021-11-25 13:01:28', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Now its alumni hold key positions in Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The school&rsquo;s critics call it a university of jihad and blame it for helping to sow violence across the region for decades. And they worry that extremist madrassas and the Islamist parties linked to them could be emboldened by the Taliban&rsquo;s victory, potentially fueling further radicalism in Pakistan despite that country&rsquo;s efforts to bring more than 30,000 seminaries under greater government control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The school says it has changed and has argued that the Taliban should be given the chance to show they have moved beyond their bloody ways since they first ruled Afghanistan two decades ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The world has seen their capabilities to run the country through their victories on both the diplomatic front and on the battlefield,&rdquo; said Rashidul Haq Sami, the seminary&rsquo;s vice chancellor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Taliban softening is far from assured, given a surge of violence earlier this year, reports of reprisal killings inside the country, limits on girls going to school and clampdowns on free expression. But Sami argued that the Taliban takeover could have been even bloodier, signaling that they &ldquo;would not repeat the mistakes of the 1990s.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Darul Uloom Haqqania, about 60 miles from the Afghan border, has had an outsize effect there. The seminary&rsquo;s alumni founded the Taliban movement and ruled Afghanistan in the 1990s. Pakistan&rsquo;s powerful military often uses its leaders to influence the Taliban, experts say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its late chancellor, Samiul Haq, who was murdered at his residence in Islamabad in 2018 and was Sami&rsquo;s father, was known as the &ldquo;father of the Taliban.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Being the alma mater of scores of Taliban leaders, Haqqania certainly commands their respect,&rdquo; said Azmat Abbas, author of &ldquo;Madrassa Mirage: A Contemporary History of Islamic Schools in Pakistan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sirajuddin Haqqani, 41, who led much of the Taliban&rsquo;s military efforts and carries a $5 million bounty from the U.S. government on his head, is the new acting interior minister of Afghanistan and an alumnus. So is Amir Khan Muttaqi, the new foreign minister, and Abdul Baqi Haqqani, the higher education minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The justice minister, the chief of the Afghan water and power ministry, and a variety of governors, military commanders and judges also passed through the Haqqania seminary, school administrators say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We feel proud that our students in Afghanistan had first broken the Soviet Union and now sent the U.S. packing,&rdquo; Sami said. &ldquo;It is an honor for the madrassa that its graduates are now ministers and hold high positions in the Taliban government.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the alumni adopt the name Haqqani as a symbol of pride. The Haqqani network &mdash; the Taliban&rsquo;s military wing, responsible for hostage-taking of Americans, complex suicide attacks and targeted assassinations &mdash; is named after the madrassa and retains connections there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 4,000 students, mostly from poor families, attend the sprawling seminary, a collection of multistory concrete buildings in a small riverside town just east of the city of Peshawar. Courses range from the memorization of the Quran to Arabic literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a recent visit, a scholar delivered a lecture on Islamic jurisprudence to a packed hall of 1,500 final-year students. They burst into giggles at one instructor&rsquo;s jokes. Other students lined up outside for lunch and played volleyball or cricket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among them, the Taliban victory is a source of great pride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Taliban have finally defeated the U.S. after struggling for almost 20 years, and the entire world accepts this fact,&rdquo; said Abdul Wali, a 21-year-old student. &ldquo;It also shows the farsightedness and commitment of our teachers and former alumni about Afghanistan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wali praised Haqqania as a premier place to memorize the Quran, which some Muslims believe will get them and their families into heaven. &ldquo;Haqqania is one of the few prestigious madrassas in the country where students consider studying an honor because of its history, the prominent scholars teaching there and its quality Islamic education,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pakistan has long had an uneasy relationship with madrassas like Haqqania. Leaders who once saw the seminaries as a way to influence events in Afghanistan now see them as a source of conflict within Pakistan. The country has its own Taliban movement, the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, which has been responsible for a slew of violent attacks in recent years. The two sides reached a cease-fire this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renewed signs of radicalism in madrassas have appeared, especially since the fall of Kabul, Afghanistan. Students have held pro-Taliban rallies. At the Red Mosque in Islamabad, the site of a deadly raid by security personnel 14 years ago, Taliban flags were raised above a girls&rsquo; madrassa next door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the usefulness of the madrassas has declined, as Pakistani officials have more recently taken a more direct role in Afghanistan&rsquo;s affairs, said Muhammad Israr Madani, an Islamabad-based researcher focusing on religious affairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amid those pressures, Pakistan&rsquo;s government has tried a mix of financial support and behind-the-scenes prodding to dial down radicalism within the seminaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government of Prime Minister Imran Khan gave the Haqqania seminary $1.6 million in 2018 and $1.7 million in 2017 for &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo; it. The funds helped the madrassa construct a new building, a badminton court and a computer lab, among other projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haqqania has broadened its curriculum to include English, math and computer science. It demands full documentation from foreign students, including those from Afghanistan, and administrators said it adopted a zero-tolerance policy for anti-state activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts on education in Pakistan say that the effort has had some success and that Haqqania does not advocate militancy like it once did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, they said, such madrassas teach a narrow interpretation of Islam. Lessons focus on how to argue with opposing faiths rather than critical thinking, and stress enforcement of practices like punishing theft with amputation and sex outside marriage with stoning. That makes some of their students vulnerable to recruitment from militant groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In an environment of widespread support for the Taliban, both with the government and society, it would be naive to hope that madrassas and other mainstream educational institutions would adopt a teaching approach other than a pro-Taliban one,&rdquo; said Abbas, the author.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The school&rsquo;s syllabus may be less influential than individual instructors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Whenever a madrassa student is found engaged in an act of violence, the wider approach is to hold the madrassa system and its syllabus responsible for the ill, and no attention is paid to the teacher or teachers who influenced the student,&rdquo; Abbas said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graduates who had studied at Haqqania in the 1980s and 1990s said they did not receive any military training. Some, however, said teachers often discussed jihad openly and encouraged students to join Afghanistan&rsquo;s insurgency. One, named Ali, said students could easily slip into Afghanistan to fight during seminary vacations. He requested that only his last name be used, citing security concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sami, the vice chancellor, said students were neither trained for combat nor obliged to fight in Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>School administrators point to recent statements by some groups in Afghanistan as reflective moderate teachings. After the Taliban captured Kabul, the Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam-Sami party, founded by Sami&rsquo;s father, urged them to ensure the safety of Afghans and foreigners, particularly diplomats; protect the rights of religious and ethnic minorities; and allow women access to higher education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, Sami said, the world has little choice but to trust the Taliban&rsquo;s ability to govern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I advise the international community to give a chance to the Taliban to run the country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If they are not allowed to work, there will be a new civil war in Afghanistan, and it will affect the entire region.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1637900442.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'where-afghanistans-new-taliban-leaders-went-to-school', '', '2021-11-26 09:50:42', '2021-11-27', '1', '1', NULL, NULL, 0),

(113, 3, 7, 'Edward Brown: “Growth with ‘DEPTH’ should guide economic transformation in Africa”', NULL, NULL, '<p>Given your location in Accra, how do you assess the performance of the government&rsquo;s sanitary and economic response to the COVID-19 crisis?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ghanaian government was very quick in reacting to the pandemic, and by the end of March, lockdown was in force. In the beginning, there was widespread compliance, and the government spent time informing and educating the population about what was happening. It showed strong commitment, and the crisis brought together the various political factions behind a common cause. As elections are planned for December this year, the tension between saving lives and saving livelihoods then began to emerge. Obviously, like all developing countries, the health infrastructure is weak. And the economy is highly informal, with more than 80% of the working population employed in this sector. It was extremely difficult to impose quarantine on marketplaces, and although there was some fumigation done, they had to stay open. Social gatherings, weddings, and funerals were prohibited, but there has been a lot of pressure for government to relax these measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the government wanted to get on with its political campaign. I hear the government has stopped testing. There are no new cases being detected, and the number of active cases is falling, either through death or recovery. Is this due to lack of testing or because the case numbers are actually falling? There seems to be an emerging consensus that the epidemic in Africa has not panned out the way the international community thought it would. It has not been as virulent and pervasive as initially feared. Various explanations have been offered &ndash; Africa has a youthful population, so they are less likely to die and therefore the impact has been limited. Also, maybe because African countries have endured endemic diseases for so long, they have developed strong immunities, whether to Ebola, malaria or other communicable diseases. Whatever the evidence, it is all pointing to the level of infection being much lower in Africa than elsewhere. The number of deaths even in South Africa, although higher than elsewhere in Africa, are still much lower than in Europe and the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Governments have tried relief packages to mitigate both health and economic effects. The Ghanaian government raised over 600m cedis (around US$100m) to be offered as soft loans. They came up with a comprehensive programme to resuscitate the economy, in part by boosting the &ldquo;One district one factory&rdquo; policy and offering funds for SMEs. But there are many questions to ask: Was this effective? Did it save jobs? Has it just boosted consumption or has it been productivity-enhancing? The jury is still out on this issue. I don&rsquo;t yet have the data so we cannot say what the overall impact has been. It&rsquo;s too early to say. Social distancing and face masks continue, but in a more relaxed manner. Until recently, you could not go into any public area, or even drive a car, without wearing a mask. It is now more relaxed and does not seem to be manifesting in higher death rates or increased numbers in intensive care. The airport has re-opened; they have a testing site there so anybody coming into town is tested. If you can&rsquo;t show a recent negative test, you are quickly tested, so you&rsquo;re not quarantined. And the terrestrial borders are also open. We need coordination amongst countries. Closing the border doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem; we need common policy and regulations across the different countries in West Africa. This would help transboundary mitigation. Rather than looking at national programs, we need a regional or continental approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that regard, the African Union&rsquo;s Centre for Disease Control CDC has done really good work, coordinating closely with the WHO and each individual country&rsquo;s health systems. This may be partly responsible for the lower levels of incidence we can see. I am sure we will see a lot of analytical work explaining these differences in performance; scientists and analysts will look at the lower incidence in Africa vs. elsewhere. There may be a second wave as we go into cooler months &ndash; we&rsquo;re in our winter right now. But generally, for a country like Ghana, with a largely uniform temperature all the year round, while there maybe be cooler weather right now, there is no evidence that the incidence is rising; people are going about their work as usual. The only thing there might be some hesitation about regards churches and social gatherings. People are going for shorter hours, with fewer people, but otherwise they&rsquo;re getting back to normal. Funerals are very important, but there has been no surge in the number of funerals, and no one is hiding to bury their dead, so we can be confident of the death figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>It seems that far from being the victim, Africa has shown many other parts of the world a strong and effective response we can all learn from. The reaction from the international community betrays an unhelpful attitude. Africa&rsquo;s performance in the face of COVID-19 has brought a useful reversal of roles.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is still puzzling. In some countries you can argue that the leadership has been reckless, such as Tanzania and Burundi. In the case of Burundi, the leadership paid for that. It is also reflective of the fact that countries have been constantly struggling to fight infectious diseases. When Ebola came, it was a traumatic experience, but they also developed mitigation measures that probably helped with COVID-19. Do we know the true number of cases? No, and many people are probably asymptomatic. We do need more robust data for better analysis. What lessons can we draw? Social distancing is not easy in crowded traditional markets. It is not clear to me why we&rsquo;ve had no big spikes with lockdown lifted. In practice, it&rsquo;s only in major cities Accra, Kumasi and to some extent, Takoradi that lockdown had some impact. In the north, it was much less apparent, and they were mainly untouched, with few cases. The highest incidences were in Accra and Kumasi. My friends who are nurses and doctors confirm case numbers are falling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>How does the pandemic affect the strategy for economic transformation? How should development models be re-thought for the future?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pandemic has certainly led to a drop in economic growth. Pre-pandemic growth projections were 3.9% for Africa overall. With the pandemic, this has been revised significantly downwards for 2020; the numbers keep changing so I can&rsquo;t quote the exact number at this time. It important to note that this is the first serious recession Africa has experienced in more than 30 years, equivalent to a total loss of $190 billion in gross domestic product for the continent. This translates into a loss of about 30 million jobs, plunging about 50 million Africans into extreme poverty. These projections, derived from World Bank sources are realistic, and imply a significant drop in aggregate demand as companies are operating at very low capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>African countries have been hit hard, including mineral-rich ones. How do we quickly recover? The theory has been: Quell the pandemic and restore growth by providing COVID-19 response measures. So far, the support has been nowhere near what developed countries can do domestically. What COVID-19 has done is to halt temporarily the transformation trajectory of most African countries. But African governments need to prevent this downward decline. The good news is that the pathway to progress will be assured if our leaders step up the momentum for inclusive and sustainable growth by providing the enabling infrastructure: roads and energy, upgrading the skills of the labor force and support for SMEs. In short, they need to step up the momentum to transform their economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ACET, we define &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://acetforafrica.org/publications/african-transformation-report-2014/2014-african-transformation-report/\">growth with DEPTH</a>&rdquo;. Let me briefly elaborate. Growth itself is not sufficient to transform economies; we need growth propelled by certain key actions. DEPTH is the acronym for those actions. It means countries must&nbsp;<strong>d</strong>iversify to hedge against internal and external shocks. The pandemic is one big all-encompassing external shock. It has affected practically all aspects of our lives &shy;&ndash; an existential threat. From an economic standpoint, a more diversified economy will be more resilient and better in mitigating associated risks. Countries must be&nbsp;<strong>e</strong>xport competitive. This means benchmarking against the best, globally and regionally. The survival of any industry hinges on the extent to which the products are competitive on the global market. The other thing closely linked to transformation is&nbsp;<strong>p</strong>roductivity. You cannot create wealth if productivity on the farm, in manufacturing, and in services remains low. And, countries need to constantly innovate and apply&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>echnology; this is key to competitiveness and a hallmark of a transformed economy. Together, the four variables (diversification, export competitiveness, productivity increases and technological upgrading) will enhance&nbsp;<strong>h</strong>uman well-being. Yes, we need to reduce poverty, but if we don&rsquo;t grow the economy, in ways that are sustainable and inclusive, we will be redistributing poverty and not creating an inclusive economy. If we want equitable and inclusive societies, economic transformation as I have defined is key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our biggest challenges in Africa is how to accelerate the demographic transition. We&rsquo;re not yet there. We have not yet been able to reap the demographic dividend, which will only come with increased education, particularly secondary and especially for women. Only then will we get a significant fall in the fertility rate, when women are actively participating in the labor force. This will add millions of dollars to GDP. We must focus on empowering and upskilling women to become active partners in social and economic development. The next edition of ACET&rsquo;s flagship report, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://acetforafrica.org/publication_type/atr2/\">African Transformation Report,</a>&nbsp;is being finalized now. Its title is Securing<em>&nbsp;Africa&rsquo;s Futur</em>e, and it will look closely at four interconnected issues critical for unleashing growth with DEPTH, including demographics. The others are innovation and technology, climate change, and regional integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Embracing digital innovations and technology will be key to Africa&rsquo;s economic transformation. But as digitization substitutes for labour in some respects, it raises concerns about the bulging youth population &ndash; demographics &ndash; and exacerbates the challenges of job creation. Africa is the youngest continent, with about 25% of the world&rsquo;s youth. We have to train the youth to reap the demographic dividend. This means stepping up the momentum to increase access, improve quality and relevant education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mastercard Foundation recently released a major report, to which ACET helped contribute, on this topic &ndash; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://acetforafrica.org/highlights/mastercard-foundation-launches-blueprint-for-secondary-education-in-africa/\">Secondary Education and the Future of Work</a>&rdquo;. Universal secondary education was one of the report&rsquo;s main themes; it will be critical to driving economic transformation and developing a future ready workforce that can responds to labour demands anywhere in the world. Foundational skills and good grounding in STEM subjects, including critical thinking and problem-solving skills are key to taking advantage of the rapidly evolving digital and technological innovations. However, we are far from getting there. The latest Human Capital Index from the World Bank placed most African countries at the very bottom. Less than 20% secondary and university students are enrolled in STEM subjects. We must get the right skills. We need to significantly increase the budget, mobilize more domestic resources, and with creative financial engineering crowd in private capital to finance the public investments in infrastructure, such as schools, roads, electricity, digital connectivity and other infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Could you tell us more about the ACET report, which is coming out, the time and details?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re just concluding the final round of reviews and putting the final touches on it. We expect to publish it by the end of the year or early 2021. There are the two topics I&rsquo;ve just talked about: the demographic dividend and what that means for jobs, especially among youth, and skills needs; and then also technology and innovation. Another topic in the report or Africa Transformation Report (ATR) is climate change &ndash; one of the quintessential challenges Africa faces. The downside risks are much higher in Africa than elsewhere, due to capacity and governance challenges. The upside is that climate mitigation measures in Africa could be very cost effective. Look at solar energy, which we have in abundance. But we need to make sure governments are catalytic, and not competing with the private sector. Smart agriculture could benefit from drip irrigation, the use of drones, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth factor the ATR will examine in-depth is regional cooperation and integration. Again, this will be in the context of what is needed to transform through growth with DEPTH. The AU&rsquo;s Agenda 2063 recognizes the importance of integrating to transform. When you look at Africa, we have so many small, fragmented economies, with small markets. Many of these countries can only transform if they integrate with their neighbors. This must be their strategic direction; it&rsquo;s not an either/or situation. We must come together to ensure effective economies of scale and coordination. This is where the recently ratified African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement is going to be very critical. The benefits will accrue to all countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ATR puts the spotlight specifically on regional public goods, because they really matter for regional cooperation and for driving the economic transformation of African economies. Benefits of regional public goods accrue to all countries only if everyone contributes. Riparian issues, such as management of big river basins like the Nile, Congo, and Niger are obvious ones, where coordinated use of water, and control of pollution bring many benefits along the watershed. The benefits and challenges to integration are well defined in the forthcoming report. Stay tuned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europe and Africa were due to have a big summit, which has now been postponed till next year. It seems there were a number of outstanding areas of disagreement on both the EU and African side, and not enough common ground. What do you think were the main points of difference?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My take is that many countries were not keen on follow-up to the EU&rsquo;s economic partnership agreements. Countries like Nigeria didn&rsquo;t want to sign up and, given the AfCFTA, there is the feeling that the EU should align with the protocols of the AfCFTA rather than continuing with bilateral negotiations. AfCFTA has become the new framework for dialogue and negotiations. This will be one of the sticking points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At ACET, we worked with the German research institute DIE and ECDPM to produce a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://acetforafrica.org/publications/policy-briefs-and-discussion-papers/advancing-eu-africa-cooperation-in-light-of-the-african-continental-free-trade-area/\">policy report</a>, which just came out last week, on this topic. The paper identifies ways to move beyond the traditional cooperation niche and areas where Europe and the African Union could act together. Beyond trade issues, you see a decline in bilateral aid, and emphasis shifted to private sector development and crowding in private capital and investment into African economies. Can we use blended finance for crowding-in private investment? Regional integration needs regional infrastructure. Each country is enjoined to build that piece of the infrastructure that passes through its country, but priorities may differ and abilities to finance this also differ. So, you&rsquo;re not able to get a synchronized approach, due to this mismatch between physical infrastructure and the finance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is estimated that about $80b financing is needed each year to bolster Africa&rsquo;s infrastructure. Landlocked countries like those in the Sahel face tremendous challenges. The cost of imported goods in landlocked capitals of Mali or Niger is sometimes twice or three times the price in coastal countries. Livestock is one of the main natural endowments of Sahelian countries, a great source for the meat, milk and leather industries, linked to regional supply and value chains, so these countries have real potential to transforming their economies. Regional public goods include transport corridors, power pools, river basin management, digital connectivity, etc. For example, in the digital space, cross-border interoperability is very important to expand access and reduce cost to larger populations and expand regional markets for goods and services. Africa still has the highest cost of internet services in the whole world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>ACET is a renowned African think tank. What role can ACET play as regards the resilience and recovery plan post-COVID-19, especially by networking with others?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broader value proposition of ACET is to transform Africa within a generation. We are a pan-African institution operating in more than 20 countries, through partnerships and cooperation with similar institutions. We pride ourselves on offering African-led solutions to Africa&rsquo;s most pressing development issues. That&rsquo;s what we tried to do with regard to COVID-19. We have developed a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://acetforafrica.org/publications/policy-briefs-and-discussion-papers/covid-19-ten-policy-priorities-for-africas-recovery-growth-and-transformation/\">ten-point policy plan for Africa&rsquo;s recovery, growth and transformation</a>. These are policy actions that governments could prioritize to speed up recovery and keep the transformation agenda on track at the same time. We summarize them in four areas. The first is enhancing resource mobilization and management, particularly domestic resources. The second is improving governance, including state effectiveness in delivery and transparency. The third is strengthening business and investment environments. And the fourth is supporting digital innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said earlier, COVID-19 offered an opportunity for different and opposing political actors to come together to address an existential threat. Thus, the recommendations in our policy paper were to encourage governments to heighten attention to transformative policy reforms.

Amoako is the founder and president of the African Center for Economic Transformation, a former executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, and the author of&nbsp;<em>Know the Beginning Well: An Inside Journey Through Five Decades of African Development</em>&nbsp;(2019). This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I loved your book&mdash;the combination of personal reflection and then a lot of great, more analytic content makes it very engaging. One of the things that really struck me about it&mdash;even as you&rsquo;ve had these positions that have continent-wide responsibilities or even beyond Africa, coming through always is your love for Ghana and your commitment to it. It resonated so much with me&mdash;I think about how I feel when I watch my own country head down the wrong direction, and how heartbreaking it is. Obviously, you&rsquo;ve felt the same sometimes when Ghana hasn&rsquo;t been at its strongest. I wanted to ask&mdash;do you think that that capacity to identify with the national project is rather unique to Ghana? Is there something special about states like Ghana where there is identification with a national identity that has been strong and distinct since independence?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that Ghana occupies a special place, and that&rsquo;s one of the things I tried to get to come through at the end of the book&mdash;what Ghana meant and what Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana&rsquo;s first president, meant for Africa. Ghana was the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence, and it inspired hope in many other parts of the continent. So in that sense Ghana was very special. But if you look at Ghana&rsquo;s political history&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what I try to explore in&nbsp;<em>Know the Beginning Well</em>&mdash;it&rsquo;s complicated. If Nkrumah had turned out a bit differently, what greater impact would that have had on other African countries? We had a situation where we went very quickly from independence and freedom to a one-party state. That was followed by military coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tats, with poor economic policy and declining growth. And Ghana got into trouble. And then we came out of it, in terms of the democratic movement, and governance started improving. We saw the hope come back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Ghana&rsquo;s trajectory has always been special, and many other African countries look to Ghana for that. Even today, with some of the things that President Akufo-Addo has been saying, Ghana continues trying to inspire a new way of doing business. If Ghana can stay on track and transform, it can be a very good model. It has always been a beacon. That&rsquo;s what inspires me to talk about Ghana. And I can be very tough on my own country, saying that we can do better, that we punch below our weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In the sweep of history&nbsp;Ghana has this singular place. I also think that in this moment, from a U.S. perspective, traditionally in West Africa we had looked to Nigeria for a lot of leadership, but Nigeria is very inwardly focused now. And Ghana&rsquo;s voice&mdash;just recently the finance minister, very clearly laying out what needs to happen for the continent to recover from the economic costs of the pandemic&mdash;is very powerful. In that sense, it makes a bigger splash than its size might dictate.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are right regarding Ghana, and the distinction with Nigeria, at least at this time. We are fortunate that President Akufo-Addo is playing an important leadership role at the continental level. And as you say, Minister Ofori-Atta is an articulate and strong technocrat. In&nbsp;<em>Know the Beginning Well</em>&nbsp;I drew lots of lessons from Ghana regarding multiparty democracy versus the developmental state. In the past I have worked with many leaders, including President Kagame in Rwanda. I have a lot of respect for him. I also worked with Meles Zenawi in Ethiopia very closely. I know the progress those countries have made under strong leadership. In a lot of African countries, a lot of people ask&mdash;which is the way to go? Is it the Kagame model, or is it the multiparty democracy model? What I try to say is this: the democracy model is messy, where one party comes in and then another party comes in, and the way elections take place. But if Ghana can make it work, that, in my view, is the best way for the rest to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In your book, you also underscore the importance of leaders having a clear and consistent vision. One of my questions is, what about an inclusive vision? I think about someone like Meles, who did have an extraordinary record of achievement in many ways, who I think wanted gains for all Ethiopians, but had very much a top-down vision. In states where there is a huge generational divide between leadership and most of the population, what is the preferred way of ensuring that a vision is shared, and actually informed by the aspirations of citizens, not delivered to them as a prophecy to be followed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has to be context specific. You mention Meles. I was very close to him. Each time I would travel to AU meetings with him, we would talk for hours. I always admired his intelligence. But we disagreed on this inclusiveness issue. I kept saying, &ldquo;Look, just open up and bring the other voices in.&rdquo; I remember one incident in particular. I was on the Commission for Africa&nbsp;that Tony Blair started, with Meles and President Mkapa and many other people. We had a meeting in Addis and there was a press conference afterward. Blair and Meles were supposed to go, but Blair couldn&rsquo;t make it. Meles asked me to go with him. An Ethiopian journalist asked Meles a direct question. He said, &ldquo;Mr. Prime Minister, this Commission has a mandate about democracy and openness. So we don&rsquo;t understand why you are a member.&rdquo;&nbsp;I froze. Meles danced around it. He was very unpleased with the question and told me so later. I had a discussion with him at his office in the midst of the political unrest following the 2005 elections, and he stated bluntly, &ldquo;You cannot deal with these people&rdquo;&mdash;in reference to dissidents. That showed you the mindset of the man. Inclusiveness was just not there. Now when current Prime Minister Abiy came in, he tried to turn 180 degrees. But the historical issues in Ethiopia are so big, it is very difficult to reconcile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Ghana, inclusiveness is there. But I have always felt strongly that our elections should be more issues-based and we should build more trust and better educate the voters. This is the goal to work toward, in Ghana and elsewhere. We should try to bring all the political parties and all the think tanks in Ghana together and make it issues-oriented, right? Pick up the key issues, have a discourse, and make sure that the issues drive it analytically. These are some of things we need to do for inclusiveness. It can be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>That sounds exciting. Then I suppose the challenge is making sure that information gets out to people, not just in Accra, but countrywide.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exactly. But you need to have the vision. And that vision needs to be long-term, and the programs need to be sustained. And you have to make it as inclusive as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As you were talking about Ethiopia, and the situation in which Prime Minister Abiy now finds himself, trying to balance order with a reform agenda, I was thinking a lot about history. In your book you talk about the importance of understanding history, and of knowing where you&rsquo;ve been to know where you&rsquo;re going. But history is so hotly contested in Ethiopia. In&nbsp;some ways it would seem to be a great strength, because much Ethiopia&rsquo;s history is quite proud. But Ethiopians have very different perspectives on their history. Bringing it up often seems a very quick way to get Ethiopians to argue. How does a society reconcile competing historical narratives so that they can find something unifying going forward?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the sense of pride&mdash;the fact that Ethiopia was never conquered and was never a colony&mdash;binds them. But how do you build upon that? Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s where the ethnicity issue&mdash;the Amharas, the Oromos, the Tigrayans&mdash;comes in. That&rsquo;s also part of the history, when they decided to go to an ethnic-based constitution. Meles would have said they were taking into account their history in how the constitution was written. But what we are finding today is that the fissures were always there. If you suppress this, it comes up again. Ethiopia has pride&nbsp;but also its divisions. How to reconcile the two?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t envy anyone that challenge. When you talk about growth with depth, you cite some examples, like Rwanda. I think about a place like Angola, which seems to be the antithesis of the growth with depth idea. I wonder, how, in places like Angola, does one turn around an economic model that wasn&rsquo;t created for that depth?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My organization, the African Center for Economic Transformation, devised the growth with depth model, and we&rsquo;re very proud of it. ACET was the first to create an empirical model for defining transformation in African terms. Growth with depth basically says that you cannot rely on just one sector, such as oil. It also says that in any given country, or any given sector&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s agriculture, services, tourism&mdash;you need to deepen and diversify your production and exports. You need to be very competitive with your exports, and you need to emphasize productivity. Those principals apply in any sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of ACET&rsquo;s flagship products is the African Transition Index, where we measure the progress that countries have been making using the growth with depth model. The latest index will be coming out later this year. In it, we see some countries have made quite a bit of progress, like Kenya, Rwanda and Senegal. Others, like Angola, are not transforming very fast. It lags well behind. The index gives you a framework to see how countries are growing. You can grow on the basis of oil, but that growth alone doesn&rsquo;t translate into the whole economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s what the growth with depth model is all about. It&rsquo;s about policies. It&rsquo;s about institutions. It&rsquo;s about leadership and vision and creating jobs. That&rsquo;s where countries like Angola are falling short. If you have these things, then Angola can begin to change its trajectory. But it starts with leadership. You need strong leadership to get on the pathway to growth with depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s probably a long turnaround, right, for a place like that to begin to see the gains from investing in that kind of model?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. But it&rsquo;s essential. Otherwise you are stuck. Take DRC [the Democratic Republic of the Congo]. With all those resources, it is still stuck. If the country had the right leadership and the right policies, you could create more jobs and lift so many people out of poverty. DRC has the resources to do that. Compare that to countries like Niger or Chad, which have significantly fewer resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You talk about how difficult it is for African leaders to speak frankly with each other, when they see neighbors going off the rails. Do you see this changing anytime soon?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way I look at it, there may have been a missed opportunity. In K<em>now the Beginning Well</em>, I write about the African Peer Review Mechanism, and the NEPAD framework. What I didn&rsquo;t say in the book&mdash;where I pulled a lot of punches&mdash;is that we missed an opportunity. The original model of the APRM was my idea at the Economic Commission for Africa. I brought African finance ministers together and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s come up with a framework for measuring our own performance and holding each other accountable for results.&rdquo; The idea was to reduce conditionality from the World Bank and other donors. That was the principle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original idea I had for the APRM was to start with a few countries, and set a bar, or certain standards, for other countries to meet to join&mdash;not start with 40 countries. I thought you needed space for the leaders to come in and speak frankly to each other. Start with ten or so like-minded countries, and over time bring the others along. Because I wanted a framework to encourage open dialogue and frankness. But that&rsquo;s not what happened. The idea grew bigger than the ECA when it became part of the NEPAD framework. Then it became part of the OAU and then the African Union, and it was open to everybody. In that setting you cannot have a frank and honest discussion. It&rsquo;s too big and too diverse, and you have to be very careful what you say to each other. It got too politicized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>On the positive side, I&rsquo;ve been very impressed with the coordination and leadership coming out of Africa around the COVID-19 pandemic, where institutions like the AU and the Economic Commission for Africa have been clear and direct and very smart in their approaches to raising the alarm about the stakes for the continent.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I absolutely agree. The AU and the AU COVID-19 Special Envoys, the Africa CDC, and the ECA have shown strong regional leadership. Having been the executive secretary of the ECA for ten years, I am particularly pleased to see Vera Songwe, the current executive secretary, doing a wonderful job. And you are right; many heads of state, finance ministers, minsters of health and central bank governors have shown strong leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My organization, ACET, is working with many of these organizations, in part through the Transformation Leadership Panel, which is chaired by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and has 17 members. What we did was to bring together all the major organizations working on Africa to try to have a more concerted, coordinated approach. We have the vice president of the Africa Region for the World Bank, the head of the African Union Development Agency and NEPAD, representatives from McKinsey, the Mastercard Foundation, so many others&mdash;all at a very senior level. Vera Songwe at the ECA is part of the panel, for example. We meet to take on some key issues, and our last meeting was virtual and all about the pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ACET has developed a framework with ten policy recommendations. The question that we asked is: what does this pandemic mean for all the gains made over the last 10&ndash;15 years? In addition to the short-term impact on health, the balance of payments, fiscal space and all those issues, how do we safeguard&nbsp;for a strong economic rebound and get back on the transformation trajectory? We had a series of meetings with global and regional organizations on implementation of our recommendations. We have also sent this to the AU, and the AU has sent it to all the African leaders. It&rsquo;s on that basis that the bank, the AU, and others will coordinate to make sure that recovery and rebound will be fast enough so we don&rsquo;t lose gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One more question. What would be your advice to a new U.S. administration, should one be elected in November? What&rsquo;s the top priority?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the top of the list, you have to listen. There is so much going on, so many ideas. Listen to Africans, listen to the leadership. Consult, and out of that come up with your programs. After that, of course, take into account your political considerations and so on. Don&rsquo;t design your programs and policies without listening to the other side. You have to connect with the people. That would be my advice.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638008472.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'a-conversation-with-dr-ky-amoako-on-the-future-of-african-development', '', '2021-11-27 15:51:12', '2021-11-27', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

In addition, the following amenities are also expected to be updated, providing an extra boost to the entire area: train station, public spaces, roads and bus routes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief executive of West Midlands Growth Company, Neil Rami, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We already know that the West Midlands is a fantastic place to visit, to invest, to trade and to meet. The international profile offered by Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games will help us take this message to more people than ever before&rdquo;.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The highly anticipated HS2 high speed rail station is set to decrease travel times to London and improve commute systems for residents.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HS2 phase 1 is expected to eventually reduce journey time from Birmingham to London, estimating at 49 minutes, compared to the previous 2 hours. In central London, a 1-bedroom apartment in zone 1 is nearly 5.5 times more than that of Birmingham, making Transport House a prime spot for young professionals seeking work in London, but wanting an affordable home of their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city of Birmingham will be the very first location that will benefit from the upcoming HS2 line, creating a host of new jobs throughout the area. The rail station is expected to generate &pound;10bn worth of opportunities, as well as supply chain contracts. Major firms have also started initiating offices in the city in anticipation of this rail project, adding onto the 70,500 global and local companies already present in the area. With the appeal of increased accessibility, job prospects and affordability, the desire for a Birmingham lifestyle is constantly increasing in popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HCT Homes and Bramham Properties say they are,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;ensuring homes are energy efficient, with the materials being as responsibly sourced as possible&rdquo;.&nbsp;</em>The developers have assured they will develop this project with the utmost respect for the local community and surrounding areas, while carrying out meticulous standards and finishings.

(126, 4, 8, 'Saif Al Islam Isn\'t Looking to Resurrect His Father’s Rule – He\'s Looking to Lay the Qaddafi Ghost to Rest', NULL, NULL, '<p>The sudden appearance of Saif Al Islam Qaddafi in a southern Libyan town submitting his candidacy papers for December&rsquo;s presidential election has caused street protests in the country and a flurry of analysis abroad over whether Libyans could really vote for a return to the Qaddafi era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, his reappearance was astonishing &ndash; most Libyans had not heard Saif&rsquo;s once-ubiquitous voice for a decade before last week&rsquo;s brief comments. But it was also just one more step in the return to public life of the Qaddafi clan.&nbsp;Imagining that Saif truly intends to become president of Libya next month is to misunderstand modern Libya, and Saif&rsquo;s gradual grasp for power. Far from resurrecting his father&rsquo;s rule, Saif wants to lay that era to rest &ndash; and lay the path for his own ascendancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saif isn&rsquo;t the only candidate to thrust himself into the spotlight. Monday&rsquo;s deadline for presidential applications led to an unedifying scramble among Libya&rsquo;s current political elite to put themselves forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some were expected &ndash; Khalifa Haftar, the commander of the Libyan National Army, is the highest-profile military figure to stand &ndash; while some, such as the current, and supposedly interim, prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, who announced his candidature at the last minute, were unexpected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Dbeibah is meant to hold the reins of power until a new president is elected, meaning he could be in the farcical situation of announcing his own victory and happily handing power to himself.) By Tuesday morning, election officials said nearly 100 candidates had put themselves forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the most surprising, and the one who will be most closely watched, is Saif Al Islam Qaddafi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His reappearance has complicated the calculations of the other candidates. For a figure such as Haftar &ndash; who announced his candidacy not in his trademark military fatigues but in a sober suit &ndash; Saif&rsquo;s involvement makes it harder to claim to be a unifying figure: why, after all, vote for a unity candidate who has waged war, when you can vote for a figure who has said nothing for 10 years? Saif&rsquo;s silence is his greatest weapon, always talked about but rarely heard from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two perspectives on Saif&rsquo;s registration as a presidential candidate are that he is either seeking to appeal to those who are nostalgic for the previous regime &ndash; including young Libyans who may remember little beyond the past 10 years of war and instability &ndash; or that he is seeking to be a consensus candidate, in the midst of faceless politicians and warring factions. As the sole person on the ballot who can command widespread name recognition, he certainly has a chance in a crowded field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But given that the powers of the presidential office haven&rsquo;t even been decided yet, and the constant rumours that the election may not even go&nbsp;ahead on December 24, it is unlikely Saif truly intends &ndash; or even desires &ndash; to win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much more likely is that Saif&rsquo;s true aim in running for the office is simply to reintroduce himself to the Libyan public &ndash; the strategy of &ldquo;coming back slowly, slowly, like a striptease&rdquo; that he confessed to in an infamous New York Times profile earlier this year. The big reveal may have lacked some drama, but it certainly got people talking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Saif&rsquo;s best route back to power is to lose this election. Not so badly that the spectre of the Qaddafi name is excised as a political possibility, but well enough &ndash; say perhaps third or fourth in a crowded field &ndash; that he becomes a kingmaker. Someone who has proven his popular support and is able to exert influence but remains above the brutal, chaotic fray. His supporters would claim he was newly humbled, a prince-in-waiting chastened by reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This, after all, is a terrible time to wield power in Libya. The government is not in full control of the country and rival militias and foreign powers still jockey for influence. The demise of his father&rsquo;s rule has had widespread repercussions in neighboring countries, which will take years to resolve. There are regular power outages and a lack of basic governance. No president could solve these issues in one term, and Saif&rsquo;s attraction as a candidate is not based on his credibility as an administrator, but on what he represents. Far better to remain on the sidelines than be blamed in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The longer Saif can stay part of the political conversation while avoiding wielding power, the further away his father&rsquo;s era will seem. The Muammar Qaddafi era will be mythologized as a period of stability rather than recalled as an era of repression. At that point, Libyans may well make the mistake of trusting Saif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qaddafi&rsquo;s son knows he has to lay his father&rsquo;s ghost to rest, in order to create the political conditions for his own rise to power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Faisal Al Yafai is currently writing a book on the Middle East and is a frequent commentator on international TV news networks.

The two countries, as well as the United States, are known for pursuing their political interests in Syria at the expense of the Kurds. How will the latest behind-the-scenes arrangements affect Syria&rsquo;s largest ethnic minority?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a small participant in the big Syrian game, the Kurds try to maintain good relations with both Washington and Moscow. They know that the U.S. is a major global power, and that Russia has a very strong influence in Damascus. The problem, however, is that the U.S. has repeatedly shown that it is not willing to allow relations with Turkey, a NATO ally, to deteriorate over the Kurds. That is why they have to turn to Russia and their client Bashar Assad for real protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan met in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Sept. 29, Turkey has been preparing for a military action in northern Syria. Reports suggest that Ankara plans to carry out a new operation against the Syrian Kurds and capture the city of Tel Rifaat, as well as Kobane &ndash; a town known as the Kurdish Stalingrad. Kobane has been under the control of the Kurdish-dominated People&rsquo;s Protection Units (YPG) since 2012, while Syrian and Russian troops entered the border town in 2019 during an earlier Turkish incursion. Over the past few weeks, Turkish and Russian officials have been negotiating a deal to address Ankara&rsquo;s concerns with regards to the YPG &ndash; an organization which Turkey considers a terrorist group due to its links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers&rsquo; Party (PKK). Ankara is reportedly considering leaving some small parts of Idlib, Syria&rsquo;s remaining rebel-held territory, to Russian forces in return for support for an operation in northern Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Russian military are in talks to withdraw Kurdish units from areas adjacent to the Turkish border to avoid a military confrontation with Turkey. According to reports, the Russians are trying to convince the SDF to withdraw its fighters from the north of Syria to prevent another Turkish military operation that would have catastrophic consequences for the Kurds. The hope is that the SDF would relocate to the south of the international M4 highway, which is 32 kilometers from the Turkish border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a purely military perspective, the Turks seem to be ready to launch an offensive against the YPG. Besides Tel Rifaat and Kobane, other potential target areas would include Manbij, west of the Euphrates, and Ain Issa and Tal Tamr, east of the river. The military units of Turkish proxies in Idlib have been put on a full level of combat readiness. Starting another incursion into Syria is now a matter of a political deal between Turkey and Russia. Policy makers in Ankara are unlikely to have any fears that the Kurds could provide a strong resistance to the Turkish army. Indeed, due to the deteriorating economic situation in Turkey, a small victorious operation in Syria against the Kurds would be more than beneficial for Erdogan. However, it is not very probable that Turkey would start an offensive until it makes a final deal with Russia, and gets the green light from the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erdogan and President Joe Biden met in Rome at the G20 Summit on Oct. 30, and the Turkish leader reiterated Ankara&rsquo;s discomfort over U.S. support for YPG fighters in Syria. Some Syrian Kurds, on the other hand, accuse the U.S. and Russia of inaction in the face of a possible Turkish offensive. Moscow&rsquo;s position is clear &ndash; if the Kurds do not withdraw from certain places in the north of Syria, and allow Russian troops and the Syrian Army to establish full control over the region, the Kremlin will simply turn a blind eye to the Turkish actions. It is entirely possible that Russia will first make a deal with Ankara that would include a &ldquo;land swap&rdquo; &ndash; the Kurdish-controlled territories for a portion of Idlib.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As reported by several Russian and pro-Assad sources, the Syrian Army is preparing for an offensive on parts of Idlib that are controlled by Turkey-backed forces. The action could apparently follow even if Moscow and Ankara do not reach a compromise over the YPG-held territory. There were also reports that Russia increased the number of jets operating in northern Syria, which could be interpreted as a message to its Turkish partners &ndash; do not start a military campaign until we reach the final deal that includes the fate of the M4 highway. For both Moscow and Ankara, the M4 has strategic importance, which is why the highway is expected to eventually be under joint Turkish-Russian control. At this point, the M4 remains closed, and the six kilometer wide security corridors to the north and south of it have not been created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the short-term, most likely in December in Kazakhstan&rsquo;s capital city of Nur-Sultan, Russia and Turkey will probably discuss this issue. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen if Ankara will get the approval for a limited military action in the region. One thing is for sure &ndash; regardless of the situation in Syria, Moscow and Ankara will keep doing business as usual. Their situational partnership will prevail over disagreements regarding the position of the Syrian Kurds &ndash; the weakest link in the Russo-Turkish Syrian adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Nikola Mikovic is a political analyst in Serbia.

(128, 4, 8, 'Satire Is Critical to Public Life, But Satirists Also Need to Show Accountability', NULL, NULL, '<p>Indian comedian Vir Das&rsquo;s recent monologue &ldquo;I come from two Indias&rdquo; did what satire is supposed to do &ndash; outrage some, and amuse others. At the end of a show in Washington this month, Das launched into a cutting six-minute routine highlighting contradictions in India around issues of sexual violence, COVID-19, politics and religion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video clips of the monologue sparked an extraordinary reaction. There was outcry over what was perceived as a litany of insults against India, but also support for the way the comedian held a mirror to the failings of his nation. Back home, complaints were made to the police and Das was even banned from performing in the state of Madhya Pradesh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The furore around what Das later described as a &ldquo;love letter to my country&rdquo; should spur debate about the importance of satire to public life. But Das and his comedy are not without problems, and the discussion should also allow scrutiny of satirists themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At its most powerful, satire, through its very irreverence, chips away at the hollow edifice of fear, which autocratic regimes and strongmen seek to build to cow their populations. Activists in Iraq and Syria, some of whom lived in territory controlled by ISIS, created animated series like the &ldquo;Big Daddy Show&rdquo; that lampooned the extremist group&rsquo;s then leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi. The objective was to show that ISIS were &ldquo;just a bunch of idiots.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humor, if deployed intelligently, lays a trap for its target to respond in a way that further undermines them. Remember Donald Trump&rsquo;s attempt to get the US Justice Department to investigate &ldquo;Saturday Night Live,&rdquo; a long-running sketch comedy series on NBC, for the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of making fun of him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When regimes have sought to clamp down on opposition political symbols, people have found ingenious ways to show them just how ridiculous they are. In 1967, shortly after the Arab-Israeli War, Israel outlawed the display of Palestinian symbols, including its red, white, black, and green flag. It is said Palestinians carried watermelons bearing the same colors to subvert these rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thin-skinned autocratic regimes, almost always led by men, have a particular penchant for clamping down on women partaking in humor. In 2015, a member of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan&rsquo;s government cabinet railed against women laughing in public, saying it spread immorality. This prompted a rather boisterous and embarrassing (for the government) backlash on social media, with women posting videos of themselves with the hashtag #kahkaha (laughter in Turkish).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Sudan, opponents of Omar Al Bashir&rsquo;s autocratic regime in 2012 declared protest days as &ldquo;elbow-licking&rdquo; days. This was in reference to Al Bashir&rsquo;s riposte to protesters that in seeking to remove him from power, they were attempting something impossible, like licking one&rsquo;s elbow. (Bashir must surely have enough time to try to lick his own elbow, given that he&rsquo;s been in prison for more than a year.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political satirists open the door to ordinary citizens to find an outlet to vent their misgivings about injustice in society. Often, the political opposition is tainted from being part of a discredited political &ldquo;system.&rdquo; Satire becomes easily accessible, and unlike political commentary or speeches, is considered cool and trendy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, the Taliban announced new content guidelines for TV channels in Afghanistan. It is no surprise that the rules clamp down on comedy programs. Autocratic, misogynistic regimes like the Taliban will seek to snuff out humor from popular culture under the pretext of preserving societal morality because genres like comedy constantly push the boundaries of what is acceptable in society. And it is only via the constant tension between what is considered appropriate and distasteful can societies hold up a mirror to themselves and evolve. Emblematic of this tension was American comedian Dave Chapelle&rsquo;s latest comedy show on Netflix, which spurred heated public debate about whether it is acceptable for a comedian&rsquo;s jokes to pit two marginalized communities (in this case, Black and LGBTQ+) against each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These debates are important, particularly when it comes to how the identity of the people cracking the jokes intersects with who is at the receiving end of them. Vir Das is&nbsp;an urban, Hindu, upper-caste, upper-class, English-speaking, heterosexual man. His various identities place him at the very top of the socio-economic pecking order in his country. The fact that he has made it this far, to be able to speak to an audience at the Kennedy Center in the US capital, is emblematic of a problem he never really addressed or centered himself in during his monologue. Not once during his delivery did Das talk about caste, which lies at the very heart of his own privilege, and which has allowed him to build his career despite&nbsp;making fun of oppressed castes&nbsp;and&nbsp;cracking transphobic jokes. Das&rsquo;s success provides the fuel that sustains the injustice he rails against in his monologue. &ldquo;Lesser&rdquo; comedians in India, who carry none of Das&rsquo;s privilege, have been thrown in jail on the mere suspicion of being irreverent.&nbsp;In January, Munawar Faruqui, a Muslim comedian from an underprivileged background, was&nbsp;jailed for 35 days&nbsp;for jokes, which police subsequently admitted, he never cracked. Das is unlikely to face the same travails. On the contrary, the outrage surrounding Das is perhaps beneficial to the ruling dispensation in New Delhi. Das&rsquo;s inaccessible, elitist humor is likely to fuel the caste-class backlash that the ruling party has managed to harness skilfully to reinforce its majoritarian project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As George Orwell wrote, &ldquo;every joke is a tiny revolution.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the revolution will be stopped in its tracks if the joke-tellers are themselves part of the problem. The joke will then be on all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Dnyanesh Kamat is a political analyst who focuses on the Middle East and South Asia.

At Glasgow, the ostrich was finally allowed to raise its head, albeit only for a brief peak at reality. Even then, attempts to overthrow King Coal were watered down by last-minute interventions from its loyal subjects, China and India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the world needs now, more than anything else, is compelling leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One&nbsp;announcement&nbsp;to come out of Glasgow was that COP28 in 2023 would be staged in the United Arab Emirates,&nbsp;home to the UN-created International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). This isn&rsquo;t the first time the COP roadshow has traveled to the Middle East &ndash; in 2012 COP18 was held in Doha &ndash; but a decade on the climate-change landscape has changed utterly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doha was not insignificant. It was one of a series of dull but necessary COPs that paved the way toward the Paris Agreement in 2015, and it was the first time that developing countries signed up to a legal obligation to reduce their emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Paris Agreement was to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. To achieve that, the world needs to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by more than 26 billion metric tons every year between now and 2030. To say that the total emission-reduction pledges scraped together in Glasgow of just over 6 billion tons fell short is to understate the enormity of the gap between ambition and commitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It highlights the monumental scale of the challenge for the country presiding over these conferences. That the UK&rsquo;s COP26 president Alok Sharma was almost in tears as he announced the watered down deal, goes someway to illustrate the personal and institutional commitments required by the host. The kind of leadership needed to rally the world&rsquo;s nations and their disparate interests to commit to an agreement often appears beyond possibility. Then there is the task of making sure the outcomes and expectations of any COP event are stuck to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK had to draw deep on its resources and global leadership experience just to make Glasgow happen. With more than 25,000 delegates descending on the city, the policing bill alone was estimated at more than $300 million. The pandemic brought big challenges to hosting the event, but it also gave Sharma&rsquo;s team an extra year to prepare after COP26 was pushed back from 2020. The UK won the bid to host the event in September 2019, but Sharma was only appointed president in January 2020 after Boris Johnson sacked his predecessor Claire Perry O&rsquo;Neill. The jostling showed the escalating importance placed on the herculean task of cajoling global powers into alignment on saving the planet. While many have called the COP26 outcomes a failure, Sharma won praise for his balanced leadership that involved building relations with small island states most at risk from rising sea levels while handling tricky meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is some of these&nbsp;skillsets&nbsp;that the UAE will have to draw upon as it prepares to take the reins in 2023. The Emirates has been entrusted to host the event based on its existing commitments towards the environment and renewable energy, including investing heavily in the new sciences of Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS), and nuclear energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the UAE has more to lose than many countries from the inevitable transition to sustainable fuels, but much more to gain than most in shaping the elements of tomorrow&rsquo;s energy market &ndash; and, thanks to its oil and gas revenues, it has the necessary funds to invest in the future today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But forging its own path is very different to consensus building between nations with conflicting interests. What lessons can be learned from previous COP hosts and how the UAE can build on their efforts yet bring its own style of leadership is yet to be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doubtless many voices will be raised protesting that handing control of COP28 to the UAE is akin to asking a fox to beef up the security of a chicken coop. Fingers will also be pointed at comments this week from the group chief executive of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) that &ldquo;the oil and gas industry will have to invest over $600 billion every year &hellip; until 2030 &hellip; just to keep up with expected demand.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to express alarm at this is to misunderstand the nature of a global energy system undergoing dramatic change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of the world&rsquo;s countries can &ldquo;simply unplug&rdquo; abruptly from fossil fuels. The world is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and demand for oil and gas is rocketing &ndash; in the process creating the essential wealth in the Gulf necessary to fund and drive the transition to renewables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the UAE and countries such as Saudi Arabia, much of the profit being drawn out of the earth now is being plowed directly into the type of research and development that ultimately will save the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAE is working hard to curb its own domestic consumption of fossil fuels. Last month, it announced it was aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 &ndash; an ambitious target on a par with those of the UK, US and EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How? Well, it turns out that oil was not the only economic blessing bestowed on the fossil-fuel-producing countries of the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunlight is the resource that gives on giving and, in the Gulf, is available for the greatest part of the year. The UAE is already leading the way with domestic solar power plants and investing in solar technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COP28 in 2023, will put one of the world&rsquo;s biggest producers of fossil fuels in charge of negotiations to wean the world from its addiction to fossil fuels. It will put the UAE in a global spotlight that will require an exemplary level of leadership and diplomacy if the climate&nbsp;negotiations will continue&nbsp;to move forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as the outcome of the UK meeting demonstrated, progress is incremental.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Jonathan Gornall is a British journalist, formerly with The Times, who has lived and worked in the Middle East and is now based in the UK.</em></p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638161344.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'uae-must-learn-from-uks-cop26-when-it-takes-the-climate-leadership-baton', '', '2021-11-29 10:19:04', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Their goal is crystal clear &ndash; to get to rich EU states such as Germany, France or Belgium as soon as possible. But tensions stemming from a feared new Cold War means these desperate refugees from the Middle East are being used as pawns in a geopolitical game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko migrants are merely an instrument. He brought them to the Eastern European country in order to punish the West for sanctions it imposed on Minsk following the crackdown on mass protests in 2020 and the arrest of dissident Roman Protasevich in May. His policy is very simple &ndash; the more restrictions the EU imposes on Belarus, the more migrants it will get. Brussels, however, does not intend to step back. The EU on Monday agreed to impose additional sanctions on Belarus. While the final details are still being thrashed out, they are expected to target some 30 individuals and entities including the nation&rsquo;s foreign minister and Belarusian airline Belavia. Lukashenko, for his part, threatens to respond by cutting gas supplies to Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a measure would undoubtedly have a severe impact on the entire continent given that Russia already reduced gas supplies to the EU, leading to an enormous increase in energy prices. However, given that the Yamal-Europe natural gas pipeline that passes through Belarusian territory is owned by Russia&rsquo;s energy giant Gazprom, Lukashenko cannot stop gas transit unless he gets the green light from Moscow. If the Kremlin decides to raise the stakes and approves Lukashenko&rsquo;s decision, blackouts in many European countries could very well become reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quite aware that the migrant crisis could escalate and have grave consequences, the West has already started pressuring Russia to limit Lukashenko&rsquo;s actions. The EU is reportedly preparing sanctions against Russian state flag carrier Aeroflot due to the situation on the Polish-Belarusian border. Some reports suggest EU leaders believe Aeroflot is transporting migrants from the Middle East to Minsk, who then try to cross the Polish border. The airline strenuously denies this claim. If Brussels really imposes such sanctions on the Russian company, the Kremlin could respond by banning the passage of Western airlines over Russian territory, which would undoubtedly result in an increase in the price of airline tickets for many destinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European threats to Aeroflot were taken very seriously by Turkish Airlines. The company confirmed that it is no longer accepting Iraqi, Syrian and Yemeni nationals onboard their flights to Minsk, except for those holding diplomatic passports. Indeed, after the EU pressured Iraq to suspend all flights to Belarus, most migrants started flying to Minsk via Istanbul. Now that the Turkish route has been cut off, Belarusian authorities reportedly plan to increase the number of flights from several Middle Eastern countries to the former Soviet republic. The West is expected to keep trying to prevent such arrangements, but if Lukashenko remains determined to keep retaliating against EU sanctions, he could bring migrants from Central Asia, or even from Russia&rsquo;s Chechen Republic, to the Belarus &ndash; EU border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poland, as well as Lithuania and Latvia, are building barriers along their borders with Belarus. Recent history shows such a measure could be very efficient. In 2017, the Hungarian government completed a razor-wire fence along its border with Serbia. The result was a decrease in migrants&rsquo; attempts to illegally enter the EU. But if Lukashenko does not stop pursuing a cold war with the EU, he could redirect refugees southward &ndash; to Ukraine. Asylum seekers would then try to go to Poland, Slovakia, or even Hungary, on their way to the richer European countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Belarus&rsquo; perspective, Western actions in the Middle East have destroyed several countries and migrants are now forced to seek a better life elsewhere. That is why Belarusian authorities constantly remind the EU that it has accepted the principle that if a person flees a war zone and one way or another reaches Germany, France, or any other EU member, he or she can apply for refugee status. Belarus&rsquo; ally Russia, through its Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, accused the EU of double standards, claiming that when refugees were reaching Europe from Turkish territory, Brussels allocated funds to keep them in Turkey. In other words, Lavrov openly suggested that the West should pay Lukashenko to stop sending migrants to the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such an option does not seem very realistic. From the EU perspective, any concessions to Belarus, be it financial aid or lifting sanctions, would be interpreted as a sign of weakness. That is why the West refuses to directly negotiate with Lukashenko, and has focused on pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin. The outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel phoned the Russian leader twice within a week trying to resolve the migrant crisis. But any deal the West and Russia might reach will simply have to include Lukashenko. He is not Putin&rsquo;s puppet, no matter how dependent on Russia his country is. The two leaders have a history of being at odds and disputes, especially in terms of energy arrangements, and Lukashenko was always striving to preserve as much of Belarus&rsquo; sovereignty as possible. As Putin recently said himself, the Belarusian president is a difficult negotiator. The EU is learning it the hard way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Nikola Mikovic is a political analyst in Serbia.

(131, 4, 8, 'To Tackle Climate Change, Engage with Taiwan', NULL, NULL, '<p>At the UN climate conference in Glasgow earlier this month, scientists were unequivocal: The only way to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change is to transition quickly away from coal, oil, and gas to cleaner sources of energy &ndash; like wind, solar, and hydropower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaders nodded in agreement. US President Joe Biden called on the world to &ldquo;double down on clean energy deployment.&rdquo; Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India said his country would generate&nbsp;half of its energy from renewables by 2030, while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said green technology would help Britain achieve &ldquo;net zero&rdquo; in power generation by 2035.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is one little-discussed yet significant barrier to those bold pledges: Without a supply chain that runs through Taiwan, one of the world&rsquo;s most vexing geopolitical hotspots, quickly flipping the switch on green power will be nearly impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An essential ingredient for renewable energy systems to work is the semiconductor. Made from pure elements such as silicon or germanium, semiconductors facilitate the&nbsp;harnessing, conversion, and transfer&nbsp;of renewable energy to the power grid. Without these vital chips, the efficiency of green technologies is limited, and their value diminished. Put simply, the promise of a greener future provided by renewable energy depends on high-quality semiconductors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which brings us to Taiwan, the world&rsquo;s leading manufacturer of these essential chips (found in everything from smart phones to smart toasters). Last year, Taiwan&rsquo;s foundry market &ndash; the outsourcing of semiconductor fabrication &ndash; accounted for more than&nbsp;60 percent of total global foundry revenue, with 50 percent attributed to just one company, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). To understand the magnitude of Taiwan&rsquo;s hold on this sector, consider what happened this spring to the auto industry. When global demand for electronics spiked and semiconductor supplies diminished, some 1.3 million vehicles were left stranded on the assembly line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while automakers generated the most headlines, the renewable energy sector, particularly manufacturers of solar panels and wind turbines, was also hit hard. For instance, in February, US-based solar giant Enphase Energy reported that &ldquo;constraints in the global semiconductor supply chain&rdquo; had hurt its production worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the importance of semiconductors to clean energy solutions, and Taiwan&rsquo;s outsized role in the chip-making business, one might assume Taiwan would have had a seat at the table in Glasgow. But that assumption would be wrong. Taiwan, which China views as a breakaway province, is not part of the United Nations system that hosted the COP26 climate talks. While a delegation from Taipei engaged from the sidelines, Taiwan&rsquo;s role in solving the climate crisis was not on the official agenda. To save the planet from catastrophic warming, it&rsquo;s time to bring Taiwan into the conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is one of the most-cited ways to curb the climate change threat. IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency, reports that it is still possible to achieve emission reduction targets set by the 2015 Paris Agreement, but only if coal and other dirty sources of power drop precipitously in the next few years. Doing that will require a significant and immediate scaling-up of renewable energy sources. It will also mean strengthening current semiconductor supply chains while developing new ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the chip shortage this spring demonstrated, Taiwan&rsquo;s supply chain stranglehold is not a viable long-term solution, and governments are moving to expand their chip manufacturing capabilities. In the US, for instance, TSMC, along with Samsung Electronics and Intel, have announced plans to open new foundries, while Abu Dhabi-controlled GlobalFoundries, the world&rsquo;s third-largest semiconductor foundry, also plans to expand production. Still, it could take years for this extra capacity to come online, leaving green energy manufacturers reliant on existing supply chains to fill their orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even the existing pipeline is being squeezed, as China has gone on the offensive to limit Taiwan&rsquo;s engagement with Western governments. When a group of Taiwanese business executives &ndash;&nbsp;including chip manufacturers&nbsp;&ndash; visited the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Lithuania in late October, Chinese diplomats warned that &ldquo;necessary measures&rdquo; would be taken in response. China issued a similar rebuke days later, when a group of US lawmakers flew to Taiwan on a Navy aircraft, a provocation China called &ldquo;sneaky.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europe, this vague pressure is having an effect. Recent momentum behind a bilateral trade deal between the European Union and Taiwan &ndash; which would have strengthened cooperation in strategic technologies such as semiconductors &ndash; stalled at the &ldquo;11th&nbsp;hour.&rdquo; EU lawmakers were reportedly split on how to balance business with Taiwan amid an increasingly bellicose China, with one German politician accusing pro-China &ldquo;Merkelites&rdquo; of derailing the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While China&rsquo;s response to Taiwanese diplomacy is to be expected, the planetary implications of sidelining Taiwan are massive. To power a large-scale green-energy revolution, the world needs the kind of high-end semiconductors that Taiwan produces. Western governments that are serious about climate change should focus less on appeasing China, and more on helping Taiwan&rsquo;s chipmakers expand capacity while building up their own capabilities. By engaging with Taiwan, and making those trade ties official, governments can secure supply chains and source a key ingredient for meeting their climate-change commitments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The climate summit in Glasgow was remarkable for its breadth. An estimated 40,000 politicians, campaigners, and business representatives gathered for two weeks to hammer out a blueprint for saving the planet. But to turn those promises into action at the speed required, the world should deepen its ties with the tiny island state that wasn&rsquo;t even on the guest list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Greg C Bruno is the author of &ldquo;Blessings from Beijing: Inside China&rsquo;s Soft-Power War on Tibet.&rdquo; He was a term member of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and is a former opinion editor at The National in Abu Dhabi and Project Syndicate in Prague.</em></p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638161562.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'to-tackle-climate-change-engage-with-taiwan', '', '2021-11-29 10:22:42', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

His exercise of power is mostly unchallenged. With his indefinite suspension of the parliament, Said rules by decree. He is unlikely to face any challenge from new Prime Minister Najla Bouden. Under the new executive orders he issued on Sept. 22, the head of state is the one who appoints members of the cabinet, sets the &ldquo;general policies and fundamental choices&rdquo; of the government, while the prime minister just &ldquo;leads and coordinates the actions of the government.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saied knows that the public follows closely all his moves and wants to know if he can deliver. In one month, his support has slipped by more than 10 percent&nbsp;and the initial streak of unbridled optimism is giving way to caution, according to&nbsp;a recent opinion poll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Saied still continues to enjoy the confidence of no less than 66 percent of the public.&nbsp;If he does not yet seem to face much opposition at home, it is because the majority of Tunisians remain averse to any thought of returning to the pre-July 25 days when the Islamist-dominated parliament held sway and conflicting interpretations of authority between the prime minister and the president kept the executive branch in utter paralysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Socio-economic challenges are not waiting for Saied to figure out which way to go. Recent figures show that unemployment has risen to more than 18 percent, with the figure among young people much higher, at an unprecedented 42 percent. It is too early to tell if and how Bouden, the 63-year geologist and first woman prime minister in Tunisia and the Arab world, will handle the conflicting pressures of financial constraints and social demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being sworn in last month, she has mentioned a set of broad and non-controversial objectives she wants to achieve but has not offered any detailed program. Shoring up the faltering economy will undoubtedly loom large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saied and Bouden inherited from previous administrations such thorny issues as unemployment, a stagnant economy, a huge debt burden and a polluted environment. By ineptitude or lack of political will, these governments let the problems fester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his first reality check, Saied told unemployed graduates he would oppose the implementation of a 2020 law that would have provided public service jobs to university graduates who have been out of work for more than 10 years. His stance provoked street protests&nbsp;even though he had also promised to launch a system of locally-based domestic corporations to help the unemployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crucial test, however, will be how to secure enough financial resources to fund the 2021-2022 budgets. On the eve of the formation of the Bouden cabinet, the Central Bank urged a high dose of financial diplomacy to convince regional and international donors to come to the country&rsquo;s help. But finding that kind of support will not come easy, with or without strings attached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Domestically, fixing the economy would also mean implementing painful reforms that none of the previous nine governments dared undertake. To balance the budget the government needs to curtail big spending, review its financial support to state-owned companies and trim the size of its bloated civil service. It will need to cut price subsidies to energy and food staples. All unpopular decisions. And it remains to be seen if the president&rsquo;s favorable ratings will be enough to overcome resistance to the reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bearing such concerns in mind, Bouden has sought to reassure the powerful trade unions of the government&rsquo;s willingness to keep all its pledges in terms of workers&rsquo; salaries and benefits. But it is not clear where the money for that will come from. Saied&rsquo;s relationship with the unions has been uneven since he excluded them, as well as political parties, from substantial political consultations. Still, his recent phone conversation with the unions&rsquo; leader, Noureddine Taboubi, could mean he is adjusting course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the appointment of the cabinet, the rest of the political outlook remains hazy. Saied has refused to set any time limits for the emergency powers and his rule by decree even though he told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the weekend that the country is preparing to exit the &ldquo;state of exception.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seizing the opportunity of his relatively resilient grace period, he announced his intent to submit his vision of political reform to an &ldquo;online referendum&rdquo; probably betting it will be approved by a landslide. The particulars of the referendum have not been made public but Saied is known to favor a presidential system and an emphasis on local politics. He is yet to unveil any clear plans for early elections but some of his supporters are already clamoring for a political party loyal to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The president sees the next stage as a &ldquo;battle for national liberation&rdquo; from corrupt practices, political meddling in the work of the judiciary and unfair economics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His distrust of political parties and intent to set up a bottom-up &ldquo;democratic regime where the people are the true holder of sovereignty&rdquo; could mean a long period of political uncertainty, especially if he continues his pursuit of his political construct while keeping &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; political forces at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saied has also to accommodate key partners in the West, especially the US and the European Union, which have put the future of Tunisian democracy under their spotlight. Tunisia will need their good will even if the majority of the public supports him in rejecting blatant foreign interference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On both fronts, at home and abroad, much will depend on the willingness of Saied to strike compromises and involve others in search for solutions. Recent moves have shown a propensity on his part to adjust position under the pressure of reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much will eventually depend on to what extent the hard facts of Tunisia&rsquo;s challenges will guide him toward charting a more pragmatic course of change aimed at addressing the country&rsquo;s many crises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Oussama Romdhani is editor of The Arab Weekly.

(133, 4, 8, 'Negotiated Settlement is the Only Way to Avoid Disaster in Ethiopia and the Region', NULL, NULL, '<p>With Addis Ababa now at risk of falling to the Tigray People&rsquo;s Liberation Front (TPLF), the international community must step up diplomatic efforts to encourage the warring parties to agree on a political solution to the conflict. If the fighting plays out any further, it would have grave consequences not just for Ethiopia but for the wider region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TPLF and its ally, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), are in control of strategic towns and roads leading to Addis Ababa, threatening a fight to the finish with the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was right to warn that Ethiopia may implode if a cease-fire isn&rsquo;t concluded quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Afghanistan or Syria, the conflict in Ethiopia stems not from the sole dispute over who is the legitimate governing authority for the country. Instead, the conflict is about the nature of the Ethiopian state itself, including firstly, how power and resources ought to be shared between the country&rsquo;s various ethnic groups and second if those ethnic groups ought to even be part of a single Ethiopia or should have the right to secede. In the current conflict, both Abiy and the TPLF are to blame. Abiy began his term as prime minister with laudable plans to transform Ethiopia&rsquo;s polity away from one marked by zero-sum competition between its ethnicity-based political parties. Yet Abiy&rsquo;s folly lay in trying to manufacture political consensus in Ethiopia via single-party rule with himself at the apex.&nbsp;The TPLF, for its part, refused to reconcile to the changed political reality in the country.&nbsp;Instead of working within the evolving system and trying to shape it, it consistently provoked the federal government by defying its authority.&nbsp;The TPLF is not a band of revolutionary democrats looking to transform Ethiopia into a liberal, democratic paradise. If it were to &ldquo;win,&rdquo; the group would take Ethiopia back to the pre-Abiy days of TPLF-dominated autocratic rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would also further catalyze, rather than resolve, Ethiopia&rsquo;s civil war, which one can argue, has been on a slow boil for the past five years. A new bout of ethnic conflict is likely to begin, with ethnic groups that support Abiy&rsquo;s government unlikely to accept the TPLF running the show. Indeed, in the past, both Oromo and Amhara groups have claimed Addis Ababa for themselves. Currently, ethnic Tigray civilians, including high-profile citizens, are being rounded up in Addis Ababa by government forces on suspicion of supporting the TPLF. Were the TPLF to roll into Addis Ababa, it wouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a stretch to imagine reprisal attacks against those deemed to be supporters of Abiy&rsquo;s government. The country must brace for a long, protracted civil war between not just the TPLF and the government but also between the many dormant insurgencies that may seize the moment to press claims for independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is likely to set off outward refugee flows towards neighboring countries and across the Red Sea toward the Arabian Peninsula. In the throes of its own civil war, Yemen is home to a sizable Ethiopian refugee population.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethiopia&rsquo;s neighbors, such as Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, Sudan, and Egypt, who Abiy has at various times provoked or allied with during his time as prime minister, are likely to intervene to protect their interests.&nbsp;Some of Ethiopia&rsquo;s neighbors, such as Kenya and Somalia, have ongoing inter-state disputes too. Like the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1990s, Ethiopia could become the site for the region&rsquo;s countries to settle scores with each other.&nbsp;For example, earlier this year, American and Israeli officials accused Iran of activating a sleeper cell in Addis Ababa to launch attacks against the embassies of its regional rivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only will large flows of refugees destabilize Ethiopia&rsquo;s neighbors, but the unraveling of the Ethiopian state will itself complicate long-standing stabilization efforts across the continent. For example, the peace deal that ended South Sudan&rsquo;s civil war, which Addis Ababa pieced together, could come under new strain. The fight against extremist militants in the Horn of Africa, where Ethiopia has played a leading role, is also likely to suffer immeasurably.&nbsp;&nbsp;A civil war in Ethiopia could also inflame conflicts further afield. For comparison, the rise in jihadi violence across the Sahel is linked to the easy availability of illegal arms due to civil war in Libya, a country with a population that is just a fraction of Ethiopia&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is incumbent upon the international community to step up diplomatic efforts to get the government in Addis Ababa and the TPLF to the negotiating table. Regional states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who played vital roles in the earlier rapprochement between Eritrea and Ethiopia, could underwrite a peace deal. The US has rightly sanctioned Eritrea&rsquo;s military and regime as a way to get it to stay out of the conflict in Ethiopia. Even as it has suspended trade benefits enjoyed by Ethiopia in response to allegations of human rights abuses by government forces, it has not widened sanctions against either the government or the TPLF, hoping to coax them to the negotiating table. The African Union, under former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, has stepped up efforts too. Yet as Obasanjo has correctly warned, the &ldquo;window of opportunity&rdquo; is limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Dnyanesh Kamat is a political analyst who focuses on the Middle East and South Asia.

(134, 4, 9, 'India’s Rush To Become A Majoritarian State Is Destabilizing the Region', NULL, NULL, '<p>India&rsquo;s headlong rush to become a Hindu majoritarian state threatens to destabilize South Asia. Under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in power since 2014, the government in New Delhi has pursued a series of divisive Hindu nationalist domestic policies. Not only are these at odds with India&rsquo;s secular constitution, but they increasingly rub up against the country&rsquo;s long-standing foreign policy posture. This is creating tensions with neighbors. Worse, as the paramount power in South Asia, India has an outsized influence in the politics of its neighbors. Majoritarianism in India is creating political problems even for those governments on friendly terms with New Delhi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh from a second thumping victory in that year&rsquo;s general election, announced plans to extend nationally a count of citizens that initially took place in the state of Assam. This exercise set the bar to prove one&rsquo;s citizenship so high that the poor (of whom Indian Muslims are a considerable number) would disproportionately fail to register themselves as citizens. The government then introduced another law to guarantee fast-track citizenship to refugees from India&rsquo;s neighbors, except if they were Muslims. The two laws, which the home minister described as chronologically linked to each other, threatened to disenfranchise Muslims. &ldquo;Bangladeshis&rdquo; became a catch-all term to refer to all the &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; immigrants the two laws were meant to ensnare. Senior cabinet ministers engaged in rhetoric reminiscent of genocidal hate speech, referring to illegal immigrants as &ldquo;termites.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These laws led to protests across India, as they threatened to alter the very definition of citizenship. However, they also caused problems for the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh. The hatred directed at &ldquo;Bangladeshis&rdquo; across the border complicated her standing as India&rsquo;s friend in Dhaka. Senior members of her cabinet canceled scheduled visits to India. Bangladesh was rocked by violence, one instance of which was directed at a Hindu temple, when Modi came calling in March this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest violence in Bangladesh, directed at the country&rsquo;s Hindu minority, was prompted by rumors that a Hindu temple had blasphemed against Islam during a religious festival. This set off days of anti-Hindu violence across Bangladesh&rsquo;s cities. Unlike her Indian counterpart, Hasina publicly condemned the violence and directed the police to arrest the perpetrators. Her party, the Awami League, even held a peace rally in the capital Dhaka (it is another matter that members of the party&rsquo;s student wing are reported to have participated in some of the violence). Yet Hasina was quick to point the finger across the border, saying that anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence in India were causing anti-Hindu violence in her country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not just a case of tit-for-tat violence across the region&rsquo;s arbitrarily drawn borders. The Modi government&rsquo;s rush to make India a Hindu majoritarian state could destabilize Bangladesh, a country of 165 million. Hasina has done herself no favors either. Despite her recent pronouncements, she has very publicly positioned herself as India&rsquo;s ally. Her party, the Awami League, casts itself as the defender of secularism in Bangladesh, and the ultimate guarantor of safety for the country&rsquo;s Hindus. Just as this has happened, Hasina has, in effect, turned Bangladesh into a one-party state, removing constitutional safeguards that foster its democracy, imprisoning leaders of opposition parties and criminalizing various forms of dissent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has pushed political opposition to her regime to the Islamist sphere &ndash; which Hasina has at times attempted to crush but has also courted to win over Islamist voters. All these factors have increased the vulnerability of Bangladesh&rsquo;s beleaguered Hindu minority. An attack on it, which is always politically motivated even at the worst of times, is an attack on Hasina&rsquo;s government and her party. As commendable as it is, Hasina&rsquo;s public condemnation of the anti-Hindu violence was motivated mainly because, like any astute politician, she saw it for what it was &ndash; a political attack on her. Yet coded in her blaming of India was also a warning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should India continue further down its path of majoritarianism, where the public sphere becomes full of toxic state-enabled anti-Muslim violence and rhetoric, this would provide the pretext for Hasina&rsquo;s opponents to weaken her government via attacks on Bangladesh&rsquo;s Hindu minority. A destabilized Bangladesh would have ripple effects across the region. Shortly after the Bangladesh violence, the neighboring Indian BJP-governed state of Tripura, witnessed anti-Muslim violence by hardline Hindu groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This cycle of violence and counter-violence across the region will destabilize the entire region. South Asia&rsquo;s arbitrarily etched borders, drawn by the region&rsquo;s departing colonial rulers amidst an orgy of entirely avoidable bloodshed, are not capable of arresting the spread of ethnic and religious violence from one country to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s traditional foreign policy posture in South Asia was always based on the notion that the continent-sized country is the center of gravity for the region. Yet New Delhi&rsquo;s domestic political compulsions are working at cross-purposes with its foreign policy interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government in New Delhi seems to think it can pursue its majoritarian domestic policies without having to worry about their international fallout. Yet as Hasina&rsquo;s recent finger-pointing at New Delhi shows, the region &ndash; home to about a quarter of humanity &ndash; is getting increasingly exasperated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Dnyanesh Kamat is a political analyst who focuses on the Middle East and South Asia.

That fig leaf should be stripped away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, the same delegations should be given a more tightly-defined remit for negotiations, focused, especially, on political prisoners; on maintaining rights and protections for refugees who return; and on the status of Idlib, the only province beyond regime control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are three policy areas that, if the regime were willing to accept limited reform, could make a big difference to Syrians inside the country by offering information on where their family members held as prisoners are, and help those refugees who want to find a way to return home but are concerned about arbitrary arrest by the regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics will say that scrapping the constitutional talks de facto accepts the victory of the regime and removes the pressure for regime change. But that pressure has faded, and not merely because of gains by the armies of Assad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A&nbsp;maximal&nbsp;approach to negotiations&nbsp;may have worked when it seemed as if the United States might remain involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But since April, the Biden administration has signaled it will treat America&rsquo;s chief legal weapon, the Caesar Act, very differently to the Trump era. The 2019 law allows Washington to impose sweeping sanctions on those who work with the Assad regime. The Trump administration used the Caesar Act multiple times; since the Biden administration came in, it has not been used&nbsp;once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That reversal has allowed Arab allies to begin formulating their own policy on Syria, with the tacit understanding that the U.S. will look the other way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phone call at the start of October between King Abdullah of Jordan and Assad &ndash; the first in 10 years &ndash; was called the beginning of the return of Assad to the Arab fold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in fact the April reopening of the border between the two countries was a test run, to see if Jordanian companies would risk being sanctioned by the U.S. for dealing with Syria. In September, days before the phone call from King Abdullah, the border was fully reopened. It followed another trial balloon from another U.S. Arab ally, when Egypt agreed to export natural gas to Lebanon &ndash; via Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taken together, it is clear that Joe Biden has taken a &ldquo;see no evil&rdquo; approach to Syria, allowing Arab allies to go their own way and restart relations. This is the inevitable result of Biden&rsquo;s focus on domestic issues &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;building back boring&rdquo; policy that prioritizes economic issues over far-flung political disputes. The scramble for Damascus is real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against that backdrop, for the U.N. and western governments to bury their collective heads in the sand and continue purposeless negotiations is to stand by as the world changes around them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretending the regime can still be forced to accept a new constitution or that it is concerned by external condemnation of its unfree and unfair elections is pointless. There will be no transition from the Assad regime, and there will be no new constitution. Perhaps, in 2015, that was a plausible, if challenging, outcome. But in 2021, it is mere fantasy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are, instead, real political successes that could be achieved, ones that could take hundreds of thousands, perhaps more, of Syrians out of the refugee camps and back into their homes; the kinds of imperfect, even grubby compromises that are hard to justify, but which could make real contributions to the lives of millions. A Plan B that would take all the institutional backing of the U.N. and redirect it towards a politics that, while certainly not pretty, perhaps would have a chance at change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Faisal Al Yafai is currently writing a book on the Middle East and is a frequent commentator on international TV news networks.

(136, 4, 9, 'Russia And Turkey Attempt To Transpose Their Bloody Middle East Rivalry To The South Caucasus', NULL, NULL, '<p>When Turkey first proposed its &ldquo;3+3&rdquo; format &ndash; the three South Caucasus states of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan plus Russia, Turkey and Iran &ndash; last December, few thought anything of it. After all, since the Soviet collapse 30 years ago, the region had been largely Russia&rsquo;s backyard, with little space for other actors to dislodge its overwhelming impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the past two months, the proposal has suddenly gained new life. Both Russia and Iran have begun backing the new format openly, with the latter in particular seeing the same thing Ankara does &ndash; a lever of formal influence on the region for the first time in modern history. For Russia and Turkey, however, the two countries now hope to extend their bloody-yet-cooperative foreign relationship from the Middle East to the Caucasus &ndash; a development that would probably have terrible consequences for the region itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most obvious starting point for serious external impact on the South Caucasus was Turkey&rsquo;s military backing of Azerbaijan in the 44-day Karabakh war one year ago. Turkish Bayraktar drones (probably piloted by Turkish servicemen) and operational planning support played a decisive role in engineering an overwhelming victory for Turkey&rsquo;s close ally, Azerbaijan. Following the war&rsquo;s end, however, Ankara was largely cut out of any clear future role: Russian peacekeepers assumed control of what remained of Armenian-held Karabakh on the ground. Turkish attempts to become involved in the negotiations and settlement process of the Karabakh issue were successfully rebuffed by Moscow, resulting in only a largely ceremonial joint Russian-Turkish ceasefire monitoring center well removed from the Russian-controlled new frontlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may seem surprising, then, that the Kremlin has seemingly acceded to Ankara&rsquo;s will by giving backing to a new framework that would give Turkey a seat at the table. By considering the alternatives, however, Moscow&rsquo;s motivations become more clear. The main negotiating format for the settlement of the Karabakh issue remains the OSCE Minsk Group, established in the early 1990s and consisting of the US and France alongside Moscow as co-chairs. Washington and Paris are arguably the two primary antagonists for Russia in the international arena, especially given sharply increased security competition between Russia and France in Africa in recent years. Turkey, meanwhile, remains a partner the Kremlin can work with: An eternal &ldquo;frenemy&rdquo; with whom frequent political and even military clashes emerge, but one with which understandings taking into account the interests of both sides can be achieved. The past half-decade in Syria and Libya, where Turkey and Russia have backed opposite sides (and continue to agitate against one another) but have still managed to regularly reach acceptable compromises, testify to the practicality of this relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this sense, Turkey will be the clear winner, and the US and EU the main international losers, of any adoption of the 3+3 format. The new framework would cut out Western powers entirely, part of why its suggestion has been strongly rebuffed to date by Georgia, with its particularly close Western links. The US and EU, already struggling to recover their influence on Armenia and Azerbaijan after last year&rsquo;s war, would find themselves largely on the outside looking in as the Minsk Group and related mechanisms take a backseat to the new reality. It&rsquo;s little wonder, then, that both Washington and Brussels have strongly opposed the new format, while Armenia &ndash; loath to both abandon the Minsk Group and give additional heft to Turkey &ndash; has also refused it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third element of the proposed format, meanwhile &ndash; Iran &ndash; is likely to continue to find itself on the outside looking in. While Tehran is the most influential actor out of the three countries in the Middle East, where it plays a large role in affairs in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon, the ways in which it exerts that influence simply do not apply to the South Caucasus. Iran thrives on operating in an environment where the state is either weak or nearly nonexistent, which allows militias backed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to dominate on the ground. The South Caucasus is a sharply different arena, with functional states in all three countries and no clear ability for non-state actors of the sort Tehran prefers to gain ground. Iran is largely ignored by countries in the region, something its recent massive war games on Azerbaijan&rsquo;s border just to get Baku&rsquo;s attention attest to. The 3+3 format would give Tehran some de jure leverage, but it would certainly be a distant third to Russia and Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary losers, of course, would be the countries of the South Caucasus themselves. By becoming subject to the sorts of Russian-Turkish power games that have characterized the Middle East, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia would become just the latest in the line of proxy battlegrounds between Moscow and Ankara. One needs only to look at how this dynamic has played out in Syria and Libya to see how destructive the rules of the game are: Russia and Turkey exert their influence on the local environment through devastating military campaigns involving indiscriminate airstrikes, empowering ruthless local vassals, and engendering a spiral of competition through violent destruction. If Iran is added to the picture, with their policies of supporting brutal militias to bloodily enforce their will in destroyed states across the Middle East, the picture only becomes more catastrophic for the people of the Caucasus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Caucasus has been through more than enough war in its history. Turning the region into another Russian-Turkish proxy playground would be an avoidable recipe for more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Neil Hauer is a security analyst based in Tbilisi, Georgia.

Although no-one has claimed responsibility, multiple intelligence sources pointed to the Iran-backed Shia&nbsp;militias. These&nbsp;militias&nbsp;not only have access to armed&nbsp;drones, but have used them in previous attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also have a record of personal animus towards Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, a prime minister who has tried to rein in their considerable power. After losing seats in October&rsquo;s election, the&nbsp;militias&nbsp;have gone to considerable lengths to demonstrate their power, staging a mass protest on the streets of Baghdad that turned deadly after clashes with police.&nbsp;For them, drone attacks and mass&nbsp;protests&nbsp;are not merely a means of challenging state power; they are in fact the&nbsp;continuation&nbsp;of&nbsp;politics&nbsp;by other means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunday&rsquo;s attack wasn&rsquo;t the first time the&nbsp;militias&nbsp;have sought to flex their muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even since the Fatah political coalition, which functions as the political arm of the&nbsp;militias, slumped from the second-largest bloc in the previous parliament to&nbsp;just&nbsp;17 seats in October&rsquo;s election, they have been claiming fraud, convinced the vote was rigged against them. Monitoring groups have found no evidence, but the&nbsp;militias&nbsp;organized a mass protest last Friday, two days before the attempted assassination. The protesters marched on the Green Zone and two were killed when security forces fired on them to stop them entering government offices. Barely 48 hours later, Al-Kadhimi&rsquo;s residence was attacked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;militias, of course, were taking aim at the Iraqi state itself with this attack, but the prime minister himself is locked into tit-for-tat shows of force with the Popular Mobilization Forces, as the armed groups are collectively known. He sends a message, and they send a message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the summer, he arrested Qasim Muslih, the head of the PMF in Anbar, western Iraq. Powerful figures like Muslih usually operate with impunity, so the arrest was seen as a major attempt to curb their power. In response, heavily-armed militia fighters took to the streets of Baghdad and took over an entrance to the Green Zone. It was a message to Al-Kadhimi that the state does not solely run Iraq.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two weeks later, Muslih was released &ndash; but, depending on your perspective, a powerful message had been sent. After all, when Al-Kadhimi had tried the same thing a year earlier, arresting 14 fighters, they were released within hours, again after a show of force from the&nbsp;militias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protesters storming foreign embassies and the drone attack are the latest round. Ostensibly, the protesters were alleging electoral fraud. But the real reason was the same as the drone attack: a show of force to demonstrate to Al-Kadhimi and the government that, even if these groups lost political power at the election, they still retain popular support &ndash; or at the least the ability to bring hundreds on to the streets &ndash; and hard power, in the form of&nbsp;drones&nbsp;and armed fighters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As post-election negotiations continue over the formation of a new government, the&nbsp;militias&nbsp;want to ensure that Al-Kadhimi &ndash; or, had the attack on Sunday been successful, his successor &ndash; understood that their interests had to be taken into account, regardless of what the votes say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The central problem is that Iraq has rival power centres, each able to exert both popular and military power. This is a problem that predates Al-Kadhimi; indeed it is a problem that predates the formation of the PMF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muqtada Al-Sadr, both a religious and political leader, emerged as the winner of last month&rsquo;s parliamentary election. But during the American occupation, he was a perennial thorn in the side of the US, unwilling to accept diktats from Baghdad and fighting American troops. His transformation into a nationalist politician &ndash; one who warned after the attempted assassination that Iraq could return &ldquo;to a state of chaos&hellip;controlled by non-state forces&rdquo; &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that in addition to holding sway over the Sadrist movement, he also commands a paramilitary organization, the Peace Brigades. That gives him influence beyond the ballot box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same is true, of course, of Iran, which backs the&nbsp;militias. So concerned was Iran that blame not be placed at its door, that it dispatched the commander of its elite Quds Force to Baghdad within hours of the attack to personally meet Al-Kadhimi and deny any connection to Tehran. Yet its support for&nbsp;militias&nbsp;that are not controlled by the Iraqi state continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Successive Iraqi prime ministers have tried to rein in the power of these&nbsp;militias, but to little avail. Al-Kadhimi&rsquo;s predecessor Adel Abdul Mahdi tried to force the&nbsp;militias&nbsp;to abandon their military headquarters around the country; he was ignored. The prime minister before him, Haider Al-Abadi, tried to drag the&nbsp;militias&nbsp;under the umbrella of the national security forces; he, too, was ignored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tragedy of the militia&rsquo;s twisted demonstrations of political power is that, in some way, they serve their purposes. Al-Kadhimi&rsquo;s measured response on Sunday before the Council of Ministers that he would &ldquo;expose&rdquo; the perpetrators is a recognition that he lacks the ability to genuinely fight them &ndash; a reality unchanged by the expressions of support from countries abroad. The last thing Iraq needs is a civil war between rival political factions and their&nbsp;militias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attempted assassination of Iraq&rsquo;s prime minister may be an escalation, but it is one very much in keeping with the&nbsp;militias&rsquo; attempts to use non-political means to express their political power. Having failed to convince Iraqis through the ballot box, they have turned to street&nbsp;protests&nbsp;and assassinations.

(138, 4, 9, 'Despite Climate Pressure, China Needs Middle East Oil To Wean Itself Off Coal', NULL, NULL, '<p>China&rsquo;s absence from the COP26 climate summit has drawn criticism from all corners. Given Chinese leader Xi Jinping&rsquo;s lack of foreign travel since January 2020, his Glasgow no-show did not come as a surprise. China has already committed to achieving peak emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, so perhaps Beijing thought it had little more to offer at this stage. However, as the world&rsquo;s biggest carbon polluter, questions over how China aims to complete its climate change commitments loom large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s push toward carbon neutrality will have a major impact on the future structure of its energy sources. This in turn will eventually alter China&rsquo;s relationship with Middle East countries that China has depended on for crude oil supply for decades. But carbon emissions from China&rsquo;s oil use are dwarfed by the damage done from burning coal, and it is cutting out coal, not oil, that is Beijing&rsquo;s immediate concern. While the end game for everyone is renewable energy, in the shorter term, the phasing out of coal-fired power stations will lead to China buying more oil from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Contrary to what many at COP26 might say, the push for net zero is likely to strengthen relations between Beijing and the Middle East based on the supply of oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s need for more oil to see it through this transition squares with Riyadh&rsquo;s plans to maintain crude production while using methods like carbon capture and planting vast forests to reach net zero carbon emissions. This approach has been labeled the &ldquo;circular carbon economy,&rdquo; and continuing to serve oil to its biggest customer China has been factored into the plan. As China attempts to bring down coal consumption while maintaining its economic edge, its demand for Middle East oil is likely to increase rather than decrease in the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is already facing a major energy crisis. The ambitious aim for carbon neutrality by 2060 was made a little more than a year ago at the UN General Assembly. At this year&rsquo;s event, China made a further pledge to stop building coal-fired power plants abroad. But the noble aims have already contributed to a severe shortage of electricity in the country this year. Millions of homes and businesses were hit with power cuts after China imposed targets for energy consumption and energy intensity. The coal-fired power plants were first to take the hit. As winter approaches and more energy is needed, China has rushed to mine and burn more coal to ensure domestic consumption needs are met and to calm anger over power cuts. What it shows is that there is a limit to how quickly China can change its current energy consumption structure. After all, Beijing has to rely on economic development and social stability for its legitimacy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This experience was a reminder of just how much China relies on&nbsp;&nbsp;coal and why it remains China&rsquo;s primary source of carbon emissions. In 2019, fossil fuels made up 85% of China&rsquo;s energy consumption, which is roughly the same as the rest of the world. But almost 58% came from coal &ndash; a figure far exceeding the global average of less than 30%. Consequently, burning coal amounts to about 80% of China&rsquo;s total fossil fuel emissions, followed by 14% from oil and 7% from natural gas. This highlights the challenge China faces in reducing coal consumption alone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The focus on coal temporarily eases the immediate concern to cut oil consumption, although in the long term oil will face the same fate. According to the Low Carbon Economy Lab (LCEL) of Tsinghua University, coal has almost peaked in China and will plateau for about a decade before it begins to drop sharply. Oil follows a similar graph to coal, but with additional, though limited, demand growth in the next decade while natural gas has yet to hit its peak by 2030 before it begins to decline. Other studies and reports agree that China&rsquo;s short-term imports of crude oil will continue to rise, with the majority coming from the Middle East. For example, the S&amp;P Global report shows that China&rsquo;s dependence on Middle Eastern crude rose in June&nbsp;&nbsp;despite the number of global crude suppliers to China narrowing to 26, down from 41 in the same month of last year.&nbsp;How much oil China buys from a country like Saudi Arabia will continue to depend on price rather than carbon emission concerns for the foreseeable future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One challenge to crude imports is China&rsquo;s concern for energy security. China has been seeking new energy sources to reduce threats to its economic growth. Beijing understands very well that carbon neutrality can only be achieved with a cleaner energy system. In this sense, China&rsquo;s carbon emission reduction is not only to combat climate change, but also to reduce its over-reliance on external supplies. China is concerned that supplies could be cut at shipping choke points such as the Malacca Strait or the Strait of Hormuz during international disputes or conflicts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like the developed countries, China&rsquo;s dependence on crude imports will fall, eventually. The Middle East&rsquo;s oil producers will have to take that into consideration and consider a strategy of economic diversification in the long run. But in the meantime oil exports will continue to underpin China&rsquo;s economic rise and define relations between Beijing and the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Yun Sun is director of the China program and co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C.</em></p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638162338.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'despite-climate-pressure-china-needs-middle-east-oil-to-wean-itself-off-coal', '', '2021-11-29 10:35:38', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

(139, 2, 9, 'Tensions With Azerbaijan Reveal Iran’s Loss Of Influence In The', NULL, NULL, '<p>One year after the 44-day war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, another conflict in the Caucasus is brewing. This time tensions have risen between Iran and Azerbaijan, following Baku&rsquo;s arrest of Iranian truck drivers and its joint military drills with Turkey and Pakistan. While a full-scale confrontation between the two nations remains unlikely, the flare-up demonstrates the deep underlying tensions in the region. Iran lost influence as a result of last year&rsquo;s conflict, while its arch enemy Israel and rival power Turkey strengthened their positions. The complex ethnic make-up, abundance of energy resources and an intersection of expanding global trade routes means the scramble to hold sway in the Caucasus will continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Oct. 1, Iran conduced massive military exercises on its northern border with Azerbaijan. Thousands of troops, dozens of tanks, artillery guns and helicopters were deployed in the largest drills since the 1990s. Azerbaijan responded by flexing its military muscles together with its ally Turkey. The Caucasus nation has also deployed anti-aircraft systems near the capital Baku, which is not surprising given that Mohammad Bagheri, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps military commander and Iran&rsquo;s chief of staff, said that in case the conflict escalates, &ldquo;IRGC will attack Azerbaijan with 4,000 missiles, which will completely destroy Baku.&rdquo; Moreover, the head of the forces of the IRGC in Tabriz, Col. Hossein Pursmail said that &ldquo;the repetition of Israel&rsquo;s threats against Iran through the mouth of the Republic of Azerbaijan is not only not in the interests of Baku, but is also a threat to its very existence.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, Israel played a very important role during the war in Nagorno-Karabah in 2020 by supplying Azerbaijan with sophisticated weapons, including so-called kamikaze drones. However, the Jewish state and the energy-rich former Soviet republic have been strategic partners for many years. Tehran now accuses Baku of also hosting Turkey-backed Syrian fighters on its territory, although some reports suggest they were already there during the 44-day war. But why did Iran remain silent for more than a year about these concerns?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After last year&rsquo;s war, the Islamic Republic lost much of its influence in the Caucasus, and Turkey significantly improved its positions. Even Pakistan managed to increase its standing in the region. In September, troops from Pakistan, Turkey, and Azerbaijan held military drills near Baku, despite protests from Tehran. More importantly, as a result of the 2020 conflict, Azerbaijan captured most of Nagorno-Karbakh and surrounding regions, which means that transport routes from Iran to Armenia now go through Azerbaijan, and not through the territory that was controlled by ethnic Armenians for more than two decades. In other words, there is a new geopolitical reality in the Caucasus, and Iran has many reasons to be worried.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That, however, does not mean that the Islamic Republic is ready to launch an attack on its northern neighbor. After the presidents of Azerbaijan and Turkey, Ilham Aliyev and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, signed the Shusha Declaration in June, the two countries became close military allies. According to the document, the parties pledged to jointly act in response to military threats. Iranian leaders are quite aware that Baku is not on its own. A war against Azerbaijan would also mean a war against Turkey, and it is almost certain that Pakistan and Israel would provide military assistance to the Caucasus nation. Thus, Tehran is unlikely to choose to get involved in such a risky adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there were rumors that the Islamic Republic could deploy its troops to Armenia to prevent Turkey and Azerbaijan from capturing southern parts of the country, such an option does not seem very probable. Armenia is a member of the Russia-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organization, and is heavily dependent on Moscow. Russia&rsquo;s peacekeeping troops have been stationed in Nagorno-Karbakh since November 2020, and the last thing the Kremlin needs is another conflict in its zone of influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Iran, however, the southern Armenian province of Syunik, which the Azerbaijanis call Zangezur, is a weak point. This strategically important region separates the main territory of Azerbaijan from its isolated exclave &ndash; the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Given that Baku and Yerevan have gradually started to normalize their relations, it is a matter of time before the two nations build a land corridor that will connect Baku not only with Nakhchivan, but also with Turkey. The Nakhchivan corridor would become part of a global trade route from China to Europe through the Caspian Sea, and would bypass Iran. Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic partially funded the construction of an international transport corridor, known as the North-South project, that goes from Russia to Iran through Azerbaijan and connects by sea with India. If there was a serious confrontation with Baku, the very construction of the corridor would be jeopardized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran&rsquo;s options are, therefore, rather limited. Hypothetically, Tehran could take a chance and fight a war against Azerbaijan, but in that case millions of Azerbaijanis living in Iran could support a guerrilla war against the Islamic Republic. Azerbaijan&rsquo;s victory in the 44-day war against Armenia resulted in the growth of national pride among Iranian Azerbaijanis, which means that Tehran will have to think twice before engaging in confrontation against its northern neighbor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, there have been signs of a de-escalation with the arrested Iranian truck drivers now free and the countries&rsquo; foreign ministers pledging to resolve differences through dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing is for sure.

For the former industrial powerhouse of Glasgow in Scotland, for example, being awarded the European City of Culture in 1990 helped lift the metropolis&rsquo;s image from violent and poverty-stricken to a vibrant center for the arts. Other cities in Europe followed, using the &ldquo;capital of culture&rdquo; label to help turn around their post-industrial fortunes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of this was lost on the leaders of modern Middle East and Asian cities who realized that drawing in visitors for an experience rather than just a holiday was key to their success. But unlike some cities in Europe, which have allowed the benefits from being in the global cultural spotlight to fade, they realized that to maintain momentum they would have to reinvent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore and Hong Kong have both gone through cycles of cultural investment to remain relevant and attractive to visitors. Dubai&rsquo;s hosting of Expo 2020 is perhaps the most clear example of a city that understands the need for reinvention. After the knocks of the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, the arrival of Expo to push the city into a new era could not be better timed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While they have their detractors, &ldquo;cultural capital&rdquo; initiatives help us discover cities we may know nothing about and therefore develop a new appreciation for their cultural heritage. The Arab Capital of Culture has been crowned annually since 1996, with Irbid in Jordan the chosen city for 2021, Kuwait City for 2022 and Tripoli in Lebanon for 2023. The initiative was set up by the Arab League under the UNESCO Cultural Capitals Program to promote and celebrate Arab culture, encourage cooperation and build understanding between cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what is the qualification criteria to become such a capital? and what is culture exactly? Is it rituals? Costumes? Arts and crafts? Is it defined by its people, history, buildings and architecture? UNESCO defines culture as the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society or a social group that encompasses, not only art and literature, but lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs. Perhaps we can add &ldquo;timelessness&rdquo; to this definition. Cities may fall but their cultural contributions can outlive the people and the powers that built it. Babylon&rsquo;s Hanging Gardens were one of the seven wonders of the ancient world and while no visual evidence exists, its cultural importance remains. The ruins of Babylon itself &ndash; the ancient Mesopotamian city &ndash; now lie within the borders of Iraq and are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Between 626 and 539 B.C. it was the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and represented the expression of the creativity of the empire at its height.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward 2,600 years and the importance of investing in cultural initiatives that bring people together, is on full display in Dubai. For 170 years, World Expos have provided a platform to showcase the greatest innovations from across the globe. In 1851, the first World Expo was held at The Crystal Palace, the centerpiece of London&rsquo;s Great Exhibition, where it celebrated the industrial wonders of a rapidly changing world. Dubai&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/dubai-expo-2020-worksite-safer-than-in-europe/?swcfpc=1\">Expo</a>, the first to be held in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, recently held its grand opening ceremony beneath the world&rsquo;s largest unsupported dome in the Al Wasl Plaza. The design was inspired by the shape of a 4,000 year old gold ring discovered at the Iron age Sarouq Al-Hadeed archaeological site in Dubai. The Dubai Expo theme and logo is a great example of reviving ancient cultural roots, creatively bringing back its history for a present day audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Destinations like Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong constantly revitalize their cultural identities in a bid to remain relevant in a fast-paced changing world that exists largely online and in which grand projects have increasingly limited shelf-lives. But is it worth it? Is building&mdash; and sometimes rebuilding&mdash; culture into our urban environments important? According to recent studies, the answer is a resounding &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and it is closely linked to prosperity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A UNESCO study in 2016 found culture has the power to make cities richer, safer, and sustainable. &ldquo;Culture lies at the heart of urban renewal and innovation,&rdquo; Irina Bokova, the former UNESCO director-general wrote in the foreword of the Global Report, Culture: Urban Future. The report, she added, provided &ldquo;concrete evidence showing the power of culture as a strategic asset for creating cities that are more inclusive, creative and sustainable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A series of three reports focused on culture is scheduled for release this month by the King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture (Ithra) in Saudi Arabia. The reports aim to promote a greater understanding of how the cultural and creative industry is evolving in Saudi Arabia and the region. One of the highlights is that cultural participation is on the rise across the MENA region, with growth prospects highest in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The report will show that Gulf states have adopted a top-down approach to cultural development. They are heavily investing public funds to establish institutions, frameworks, infrastructure, and spaces to enable the creative industry not only to exist, but to thrive. In contrast, the Levant and North African Arab countries have pursued a bottom-up approach, driven by private and grassroots initiatives and a vibrant cultural scene. Both approaches seem to be working with 90% of MENA respondents saying cultural participation is important to them, and 75% valued it more than other entertainment options such as watching TV or playing sport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This widening desire for people to be involved in cultural experiences validates the approach to give cultural booster shots to metropolitan areas or risk an overall demise. Royal courts in the past would parade their opulence and cultural significance through their art pieces and prominent cultural figures of the time. However, today, the court of public opinion exists on a global grander scale. There is an intrinsic link between culture and economic prosperity, where there is a co-dependent requirement for extravagance, to keep a cultural city relevant and to hold the attention of the traveling masses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Rym Tina Ghazal is the editor in chief of an arts and culture magazine, and a former war correspondent.</em></p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638162501.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'how-cultural-reinvention-keeps-the-worlds-great-cities-from-fading', '', '2021-11-29 10:38:21', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

It Doesn’t Deserve It Unless It Is Reformed', NULL, NULL, '<p>Lebanon is a country teetering on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/lebanon-failed-state-not-democracy/\">implosion</a>, threatening the world with a flood of terrorism, narcotics and refugees. Besides everything else that ails the country &ndash; and there is plenty &ndash; it must now plead for donations for its army. You have to ask yourself, what kind of state asks for donations to pay its soldiers and keep them fed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fearing disaster, foreign countries have of course ponied up. In early September, the army received 10 tonnes of food aid from Jordan. But the largest benefactor is the United States, and where it leads, others follow. Washington has spent close to $400 million so far this year to preserve whatever is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/lebanon-israel-maritime-border/\">left</a>&nbsp;of the Lebanese state. Besides providing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/as-a-lunchtime-staple-becomes-a-luxury-lebanon-sinks-further-into-crisis/\">food</a>&nbsp;to those living in poverty and arranging for gas supplies to produce enough&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/lebanon-gas-egypt-electricity-syria/\">electricity</a>&nbsp;to keep vital facilities &ndash; such as hospitals &ndash; working, America has been bankrolling the army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, counterintuitively, the US should stand down and others should follow. The Lebanese army does not deserve to be preserved if it is not radically reformed. America&rsquo;s dollars to Lebanon don&rsquo;t help solve the problem; they aggravate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lebanese army is not the only military organization in the country. After the 2006 war between the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/iran-saudi-allies/\">Iran</a>-controlled Hezbollah and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/biden-will-urge-more-normalization-of-arab-israel-relations/\">Israel</a>, the UN passed Security Council Resolution 1701 to enlarge an existing peacekeeping force &ndash; the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) &ndash; to 10,000 soldiers from 2,000. The force&rsquo;s mandate was expanded to include inspection of suspected Hezbollah arms caches south of the Litani river in southern Lebanon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 43-year-old &ldquo;interim&rdquo; UN force costs $500 million a year, of which America contributes $145 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its expanded size and increased cost, Unifil has proven to be as useless as it has always been. Its convoys of troops that try to bust provocative Hezbollah military positions are always intercepted by &ldquo;locals&rdquo; (read: Hezbollah operatives) who block roads with burning tires and hurl rocks at the troops. Since 2006, Hezbollah has dictated which roads Unifil can use and which ones it cannot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The failure of Unifil is one of the excuses the Lebanese state uses to recuse itself from trying to control the foreign&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/broken-and-broke-lebanon-has-a-choice-a-state-of-peace-or-of-perpetual-war/\">proxy militia</a>&nbsp;on its soil. Lebanese officials argue that Hezbollah is an international problem, and if the UN and its international peacekeeping force cannot deal with it, then why expect a much weaker Lebanese state and its even weaker army to succeed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lebanon now has three armed forces &ndash; its army, Unifil and, the most powerful of them all, Hezbollah. Lebanese sovereignty is in the hands of a militia that takes its order from Tehran, regardless of the interest or the will of the Lebanese and their elected government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lebanon&rsquo;s military arrangement, where Hezbollah calls the shots while the two other powers stand idly by, questions the wisdom of Washington throwing the Lebanese army a lifeline. A case of course can be made for the urgent need of a minimum supply of electricity for the health sector, but there is no such urgency for an army that can neither assert state sovereignty nor has the tools or ability to help fight surging crime, including the prospering narcotics industry. (The normal crime-fighting institution to be found in any state, the police, are even less reliable as a bulwark against illegality.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Armies usually reflect the state and society they serve. Competent and strong states produce professional armed forces; disintegrating and weak governments command armies in their image: corrupt and useless ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Lebanese army has often presented itself as the only decent, non-corrupt and &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; state institution, it has been in fact as corrupt as the rest of the state. Promotions are not based on merit but effected through political intervention. Senior officers are offered salaries and perks that are not commensurate with their skills or available state resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while the Lebanese army has always presented itself as standing above the country&rsquo;s sectarian and political fray, it has in reality been a political player for a long time. The Lebanese army chooses its battles in ways that keep high the chances of its commander being eventually elected president. The last three Lebanese presidents &ndash; Emile Lahoud, Michel Suleiman and the incumbent Michel Aoun &ndash; all served as army commanders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For America to pretend that the Lebanese army is worth bankrolling, but not the rest of the Lebanese bureaucracy, is intellectual laziness. Whoever is drafting such US foreign policy is just checking boxes to show their superiors, and the world, that America is trying to help prevent Lebanon&rsquo;s implosion. America&rsquo;s dollars are in effect feeding the same beast &ndash; corruption and Hezbollah &ndash; that has destroyed Lebanon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unless there is substantial reform that includes the Lebanese army, and that also downscales Unifil, the $1 billion that America plans to spend on Lebanon every year will only contribute to keeping Lebanon stable enough so that Hezbollah and Iran can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/hezbollah-dont-farm-beirut-explosion/\">tighten their grip</a>&nbsp;on the country and cause mischief in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Washington and other foreign capitals want to avert disaster in Lebanon, they should heed this Lebanese maxim: &ldquo;If the problem does not get bigger, it will never get smaller.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hussain Abdul-Hussain is a research fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, in Washington, DC.</em></p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638162591.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'lebanons-army-seeks-aid-it-doesnt-deserve-it-unless-it-is-reformed', '', '2021-11-29 10:39:51', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(142, 4, 9, 'Central Bank Digital Currencies Will Make Your Wallet Obsolete', NULL, NULL, '<p>There is an unmistakable buzz around central bank digital currency, or CBDC. The Bahamas became the first country to issue a CBDC last year. And on October 1, the central bank of Nigeria unveiled its e-Naira. Last year, China began trial of its digital yuan in four cities. The US and Britain are busy working on pilot programs, and issuing research papers outlining how their own CBDC might work. Still, many people distrust the idea and mistake it for a form of cryptocurrency. They shouldn&rsquo;t, and it isn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which raises the obvious question: what is a CBDC? The simple answer is that CBDCs are just like money in your wallet. Except it isn&rsquo;t printed &ndash; that is, issued &ndash; on paper. It is instead issued electronically. Like a paper currency, every CBDC has a serial number and is identifiable. In contrast, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/turkey-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin/\">Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;is like a pot of gold and thus is not uniquely identifiable. Owning a couple of Bitcoins is like hoarding a few ounces of gold. Like gold, you can shave off bits to pay someone or accumulate bits of Bitcoin into a crypto &ldquo;lump.&rdquo; It is infinitely &ldquo;smeltable,&rdquo; so to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, you might protest that this doesn&rsquo;t sound terribly different from digital payments with your credit card. Or electronic bank transfers. Well, it is different. Digital payments are a form of checks: instructions to pay money from your account. That money eventually is represented by physical cash printed by a central bank &ndash; it may be digitally represented in your account, but there is a store of that physical money somewhere to back it up. Each time you use electronic payment for your coffee, there are intermediaries matching your payment to your bank account and then transferring it to Starbucks&rsquo;s. You need Mastercard or Visa to be the middleman, a role for which they take a fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For simplicity sake, handing over digital yuan in Shenzhen (one of China&rsquo;s trial sites) for some dumplings is like forking over cash from your wallet. It goes directly from you to the vendor. There are no intermediaries &ndash; just like with cryptocurrencies. But unlike cryptocurrencies, the unique identity of every CBDC means it is possible to trace the route each CBDC travels. There is an electronic record of every transaction, unlike traditional fiat money. This makes it harder to launder money or to finance illegal activities undetected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for all that, many people are concerned that their &ldquo;real money&rdquo; is being shoveled into a Ponzi scheme that they believe cryptocurrencies to be. Most people still don&rsquo;t understand what a blockchain is, and cannot comprehend how the technology enables CBDCs and cryptocurrencies. Indeed, the fact that CBDCs depend on blockchain just like cryptocurrencies immediately make them suspicious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, cryptocurrencies and CBDCs are interchangeable terms in many people&rsquo;s mind. And a problem with one tar the other. Consider El Salvador&rsquo;s adoption of Bitcoin &ndash; not a CBDC, mind you &ndash; as a national currency in September. It didn&rsquo;t go smoothly. There was confusion among some residents, and international observers warned that the country would be isolating itself from the global economy (such is the fear mongering about cryptocurrencies) and publicly wondered about the true intentions of those running the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the real problem was that days after El Salvador took the plunge into Bitcoin, the red-hot new blockchain and cryptocurrency, Solana, experienced a 17-hour outage. Solana is a more efficient alternative to popular blockchains like Ethereum and is seen by many who understand these things as the future of cryptocurrency. But then it went down for over a day, leading some to question the strength of its technology and for concerns to spill over to other cryptocurrencies and CBDCs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lost in the sea of hot takes about these two events is a fact that most take for granted: We are in the very early stages of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and CBDCs. This isn&rsquo;t a value judgment on the use and efficiency of blockchains or cryptocurrencies. Instead, it&rsquo;s a humble reminder that we are in the early days of a profoundly innovative technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back at the dawn of the internet, a virus called the Morris worm in 1988 infected up to 10 percent of computers connected to the internet. Despite this crippling event, which naysayers at the time cited as a potential downside of the internet as a whole, the web has fared remarkably well. Instead of seeing the Solana outage as evidence of the inferiority of cryptocurrencies, it&rsquo;s more instructive to see these developments as a natural part of an emerging technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which brings us back to CBDCs. Why bother if most people and banks are happy enough with digital transactions of the current variety? The answer is that the infrastructure for money is changing. We&rsquo;ve had paper money since China&rsquo;s Tang dynasty in the 7th century, although it didn&rsquo;t really take off until the Song dynasty in the 11th century. Technology has accelerated in the last 100 years alone to the point where we must reevaluate how we structure society, including money. There is a clear need to remain abreast of technological improvements. Digital currencies work, cut down on corruption, are easy to use and are much easier to control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t take my word for it. That&rsquo;s what the IMF has repeatedly argued. In an article it published in July on its website, it said that the &ldquo;advantages of [digital currencies&rsquo;] underlying technologies, including the potential for cheaper and more inclusive financial services, should not be overlooked. Governments, however, need to step up to provide these services and leverage new digital forms of money while preserving stability, efficiency, equality and environmental sustainability.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drive by major central banks to establish digital currencies is about relevance in a changing technological landscape. Yet, this shift to digital money won&rsquo;t happen overnight, and there will be hiccups along the way. Just as the internet underwent major growing pains (and still is), digital currencies have a long road of maturity ahead. It&rsquo;s still early days. Still, instead of carrying cash in your wallet, you should expect in some near future to pay with an iris scan, thumbprint or the shape of your face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Joseph Dana is the senior editor of Exponential View, a weekly newsletter about technology and its impact on society.

(143, 4, 11, 'China Sees No Return on Investment in Biden’s ‘Compartmentalized’ Cooperation', NULL, NULL, '<p>Recent efforts by the Biden administration to engage with Beijing have been little short of a disaster. A visit by deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman in July was met with two Chinese lists of demands for US policy changes. John Kerry, Biden&rsquo;s climate change envoy, traveled to Beijing a month later and received a clear message that the cooperation he sought on global warming was not going to happen due to US hostility. Washington&rsquo;s hope of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/biden-should-learn-from-trump-on-china/\">leadership summit</a>&nbsp;between Biden and president Xi Jinping appears improbable, though they may hold a virtual meeting before the end of the year. It is almost certain that Xi will not attend the G20 Summit in Rome in person, and there is almost no discussion in China that he will travel to Glasgow for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/climate-change-was-a-threat-to-the-world-before-covid-19-and-will-still-be-a-threat-after-the-virus-is-gone/\">COP26</a>&nbsp;climate meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many in China have described the current state of US-China relations as a stalemate. They say Biden has adopted a path no more confrontational or cooperative than his predecessor, while maintaining the focus on competition. The real wrench in the works stems from the two completely different approaches to how the superpowers want to engage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden&rsquo;s approach is to deal with the different issues with China separately, or &ldquo;compartmentalized.&rdquo; The pursuit of competition, cooperation and confrontation with Beijing are being run in parallel. This approach fundamentally conflicts with the Chinese view that discussions should be interconnected across all areas, ie, through &ldquo;issue linkage.&rdquo; Without addressing this fundamental conflict, Washington&rsquo;s desire for a relationship based on &ldquo;responsible competition&rdquo; may not transpire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden&rsquo;s strategy of compartmentalizing different areas of US-China relations has been clear since he took office. Secretary of state Antony Blinken described the approach as &ldquo;competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be and adversarial when it must be.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following this logic, the US seeks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/china-rise-north-africa/\">compete vigorously with China in all areas</a>&nbsp;and actively counter Chinese security threats, especially on Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the policy does not preclude cooperation. From climate change to regional challenges, including North Korea, Iran, Myanmar and Afghanistan, the US sees cooperation as feasible and desirable for both countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, if the US and China can compete in their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/beijing-tehran-agreement-trying-to-usurp-us-in-middle-east-its-complicated/\">comprehensive national power</a>&nbsp;but still cooperate in areas of common interest, it would help shape a healthier bilateral relationship and serve the US well, goes the thinking in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Chinese, the evidence from the last eight months show that this compartmentalized approach does not work. In their view, Kerry might repeatedly visit China to seek climate change cooperation, but it does not stop the US from continuing tariffs on Chinese products imposed by the Trump administration. Similarly, Biden can have a phone call with Xi where he discusses &ldquo;the responsibility of both nations to ensure competition does not veer into conflict.&rdquo; But this does not stop his administration from engaging in &ldquo;anti-China&rdquo; moves immediately after. The day after a phone conversation between the two in September, it was reported that the US was considering allowing Taipei to include &ldquo;Taiwan&rdquo; in the official name of its Washington office. The move infuriated Beijing, which views the democratically ruled island as its own territory. Then, a week after that call, the US said it would provide&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/aukus-deal-iran-nuclear-goals/\">nuclear-powered submarine technology to Australia.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach creates confusion in Beijing. Chinese analysts have been grappling with what they perceive as an inconsistent and conflicting approach. For the Chinese, the competitive nature of bilateral relations is not only toxic but has determined that the two countries will seek all possibilities to gain advantages in bilateral issues. That means their diverging interests overwhelm most, if not all, converging interests. It also means Beijing perceives any cooperation with the Biden administration as &ldquo;favors,&rdquo; with no return on investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Beijing, the solution for managing relations with the US has always been issue linkage. Chinese cooperation on issues from domestic market access to foreign conflict resolution was leveraged against the US to extract compromises in areas China deemed critical, such as Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and human rights. The quid pro quo was so prevalent over four decades that Beijing understood it could always bargain. For China, a bilateral give-and-take is the default state of US-China relations. When the Biden administration introduced a framework that compartmentalized these issues, the Chinese reaction was to shut down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implication of this clash is two-fold. First, for China the overall nature of the relationship has soured on a strategic level. Therefore, so goes the thinking, any cooperation on a tactical level is only going to benefit the Americans. Even when such cooperation is in China&rsquo;s interest, China would not give the US the satisfaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Chinese perception is evident most recently in its handling of the climate change issue and Afghanistan. Although Beijing recognizes the need for action on global warming and agreed to stop building new coal-fired power plants overseas, it used the UN framework to announce it rather than a bilateral US-China setting. Doing the latter would have given Biden a win. On&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/china-afghanistan-policy-pakistan/\">Afghanistan</a>, China could have answered the US call for cooperation on stability and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/aid-afghanistan/\">humanitarian assistance</a>. Instead, Beijing deliberately avoided it and chose unilateral engagement with the Taliban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second implication is that the compartmentalized approach removes Chinese interest in tactical cooperation that could benefit China. The bar for cooperation has been raised extremely high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither the US nor China can force each other to accept its approach. As such, the stalemate will continue. If China is unwilling to cooperate, the US might have to abandon the strategy eventually. That will push competition and confrontation to the front line, and it may not be the healthy and responsible competition anyone had envisioned.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638162811.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'china-sees-no-return-on-investment-in-bidens-compartmentalized-cooperation', '', '2021-11-29 10:43:31', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Again, this is a near-fantastic rate among 200,000 workers over 247 million work hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More seriously for the credibility of the anti-Dubai coverage, the number of deaths and injuries during the six-year construction of Expo 2020 is far below the average for the Western construction industry in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March, the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health released its annual construction fatality report, which revealed that in 2019 24 construction workers died in New York City, with migrant workers from Latin America accounting for one in five of the deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UK, meanwhile, statistics from the Health and Safety Executive record that in the year to March 2021 there were 39 construction deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expo 2020 makes the point that its &ldquo;accident frequency rate&rdquo; &ndash; a calculation used to measure incidents over a period of time worked &ndash; was 0.03, compared with 0.07 in the construction industry in Britain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other statistics come to Dubai&rsquo;s defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Union keeps tabs on the safety of employees through the application of a metric known as the incidence rate &ndash; the number of non-fatal or fatal accidents at work for every 100,000 employees. In 2018, the 27 countries in the EU had an average incidence rate of about 1,600 serious accidents for every 100,000 workers. With just 73 accidents over six years, the incidence rate per year at Expo 2020 was a mere six per year for every 100,000 workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, the incidence rate for fatal accidents in the EU in 2018 was 2.21 fatal accidents per 100,000 persons. Expo 2020? Just 0.25 per 100,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Europe&rsquo;s construction industry is not responsible for all of Europe&rsquo;s deaths at work. But it is responsible for 20 percent of them, which means that with a rate of 0.44 deaths per 100,000 its safety record in terms of fatalities is almost twice as bad as Expo 2020&rsquo;s, with a similar disparity in non-fatal injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics, in other words, show the highlighting of the deaths and injuries during the construction of Expo 2020 to be wholly unwarranted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what about the exploitation of all those workers from South Asia? This is a tired old chestnut, which Dubai and the UAE has addressed time and time again, opening up labor accommodations for inspection and enforcing a strictly observed safety code which, among other things, bans outdoor working during the hottest hours of the day in the summer months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have there been infringements of such rules on the Expo site? Yes. This has been a gigantic project, with no fewer than 2,000 main contractors and another 2,000 subcontractors, each of which employs its own labor direct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Dubai Expo&rsquo;s worker welfare unit investigated and acted swiftly whenever breaches of employment codes came to light, and at least two contractors lost their contracts after failing to address reported violations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the issues that has plagued migrant employment in the UAE is the practice among unscrupulous recruiters operating in workers&rsquo; home countries of demanding hiring fees. This practice is banned by the UAE and, following an in-house Expo investigation, 300 workers who had been charged this illegal fee were reimbursed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And two key points are never made in all the carping media coverage of the &ldquo;plight&rdquo; of the migrant workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first is that they wouldn&rsquo;t be coming to the Gulf states to work if conditions and job availability in their home countries were any better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second is that millions of people in countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh &ndash; entire communities, in many cases &ndash; rely on the money the migrant workers earn and send home: in a typical year, over $4.6 billion dollars flows into Pakistan alone in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/the-gulf-is-ideally-placed-to-steal-facebooks-thunder-and-dominate-the-remittance-market/\">remittances</a>&nbsp;from the UAE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the hypocrisy of the negative Expo 2020 coverage will not be lost on those who have been following the slow-motion car crash that is the consequence of the UK&rsquo;s disastrous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/brexit-britain-should-want-to-be-like-singapore-to-get-there-it-will-first-have-to-pass-through-the-gulf/\">Brexit</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK is currently in the grip of a series of economic crises, all of which are related to the fact that many of its industries, from farming to transport, can no longer rely on the cheap labor they used to get from poorer European countries. Britons were not prepared to work for the low pay and poor conditions on offer, and still aren&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is now apparent is that for the UK, the &ldquo;freedom of movement&rdquo; it has now turned its back on meant the freedom to exploit labor from poorer countries.

(145, 4, 11, 'China’s Rise in North Africa Won’t Abate Anytime Soon', NULL, NULL, '<p>China has been increasing its footprint in North Africa over the past decade. While Europe remains North Africa&rsquo;s primary economic partner, China has taken advantage of the decreasing influence of the West in the region. Indeed, even the<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/tunisia-is-in-crisis/\">&nbsp;Tunisian president</a>&rsquo;s recent seizure of power from the country&rsquo;s parliament and prime minister elicited very little reaction from Europe. China&rsquo;s avowed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/china-afghanistan-policy-pakistan/\">non-interventionist</a>&nbsp;approach toward local politics &ndash; as opposed to an America and European emphasis on human rights and good governance &ndash; makes it an appealing partner for North African leaders. Meanwhile, the region&rsquo;s geostrategic importance, at the crossroads of Africa, the Middle East and the southern Mediterranean, make it a crucial area for China&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/after-the-pandemic-is-a-china-led-world-order-inevitable/\">expansionist agenda</a>. None of this, however, offers much benefit to the people who actually populate the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beijing is pursuing a development model in the region that leaders who are increasingly less interested in a path of Western-style democracy find appealing &ndash; a model that marries economic growth with authoritarianism. Yet, even that economic benefit might not truly filter down. In addition, Chinese investment has been criticized in other regions for creating a form of debt dependency that North African countries, many of which are already plagued with high levels of debt, cannot afford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowhere is China&rsquo;s interest in North Africa clearer than through its flagship Belt and Road Initiative. China has signed BRI agreements with every North African state. The BRI spans a variety of arenas, including infrastructure development, technical assistance, cultural partnerships and trade facilitation. China is also keen to secure access to Algerian and Libyan oil and gas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China became Algeria&rsquo;s top trading partner in 2013, overtaking France. However, analysts have noted that there has been little benefit from the increasing Chinese interest, with Algeria funding most development projects and China transferring little technology or expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, both Morocco and Tunisia have increased their trade with China, which now ranks third in both countries, behind France and Spain. At the outset of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/middle-east-proxy-libya/\">Libyan</a>&nbsp;uprising in 2011, China had a large footprint in the country, operating around 75 businesses, 50 infrastructure projects using more than 36,000 Chinese workers and holding contracts worth around $20 billion. While the civil war put a damper on much of China&rsquo;s investment activities, Beijing is eager to assist with post-conflict infrastructure development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While China&rsquo;s BRI investments have been large, the bulk of its interest in the region in fact has been on the soft-power side. Diplomatically, North African states benefit from two regional forums &ndash; the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum founded in 2004 and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation founded in 2006. Each of these bodies allows North African officials to engage in regular, high-level dialogue with Chinese officials. Additionally, China has had a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Algeria since 2014 and a Strategic Partnership with Morocco since 2016. Through these partnerships, China has been able to &ldquo;soft balance&rdquo; against the West and Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the education arena, North Africa is home to four Confucius Institutes &ndash; three in Morocco and one in Tunisia, as well as a Confucius Classroom in the latter. The Institutes are designed to promote Chinese language and culture, but have been criticized for promoting Chinese propaganda and impinging on academic freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourism is another important tool of Chinese soft power. Both Morocco and Tunisia have relaxed visa restrictions on Chinese tourists over the past several years, leading to an increase in visits. In Tunisia, the number of Chinese tourists jumped from 8,000 in 2016 to 20,000 in 2017. Morocco saw 43,000 Chinese tourists in 2016, and five times that number in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While soft power remains China&rsquo;s predominant area of intervention in the region, there are several notable hard-power projects as well. China&rsquo;s investment in undersea cables (such as the Hannibal cable between Tunisia and Italy and the cable between Libya and Greece) has provided critical telecommunications infrastructure to the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is concern that Chinese technology could be used as a backdoor into the security services and government operations of North African states. In some cases, the use of the Chinese company Huawei&rsquo;s surveillance technology is not a secret. Algeria has reportedly deployed Huawei&rsquo;s surveillance technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Africa, and Algeria in particular, is also a major destination for Chinese arms exports. Between 2010 and 2020, Algeria alone made up almost 30 percent of Chinese arms sales to Africa. While Morocco still buys the bulk of its weapons from the US, China is expanding its military-to-military cooperation. Beijing has also been tightening relations with Tunisia. Following a meeting between the Chinese and Tunisian defense ministers in 2019, both countries said they wanted to strengthen military cooperation. On that score, Beijing will be gratified by Washington&rsquo;s muted response to president&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/tunisian-democracy-vote-saied/\">Kais Saied</a>&rsquo;s imposition of emergency rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what do the people of North Africa actually gain from such engagement with Beijing? China certainly is not in the business of promoting or even welcoming the social and political reforms needed to bring about stability and long-term economic growth that will improve the daily lives of North Africans. And China&rsquo;s investments do not bring many local jobs with them, as its companies usually prefer to bring in Chinese workers. Tourism may be the only bright point &ndash; though how long it might take to recover after the Covid-19 pandemic recedes is impossible to determine just yet. In all, the benefits of China&rsquo;s engagement with North Africa mostly accrues to Beijing&rsquo;s side of the ledger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The region might be better served from a recommitment by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/to-counter-chinas-rise-the-us-needs-its-gulf-state-allies/\">US and Europe</a>, which might offer palpable inducements of development aid linked to reforms. But with Western governments focused on their own domestic spending plans and Covid-19 recovery, it is more likely that continuing Chinese funds and outreach will further entrench Beijing&rsquo;s influence in the region for the foreseeable future.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638162968.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'chinas-rise-in-north-africa-wont-abate-anytime-soon', '', '2021-11-29 10:46:08', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(146, 4, 11, 'China’s Afghanistan Policy Runs Through Pakistan', NULL, NULL, '<p>China has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/china-opportunities-taliban-afghanistan/\">moved quickly</a>&nbsp;to try and build influence with Afghanistan&rsquo;s new government, headed by the Taliban. As early as July, as the war was turning decidedly in the Taliban&rsquo;s favor, China&rsquo;s foreign minister, Wang Yi, hosted the Taliban&rsquo;s then political chief and now Afghanistan&rsquo;s deputy prime minister, Abdul Ghani Baradar, in Tianjin. In early September, Beijing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/aid-afghanistan/\">pledged $31 million in health and food assistance</a>&nbsp;to its western neighbor. However, it is either unable or unwilling to carry out its policy vis-&agrave;-vis Afghanistan on its own, and is likely to recruit Pakistan into plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, China&rsquo;s diplomacy appears to have been effective. In an interview to China&rsquo;s state-run Global Times newspaper on September 10, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen claimed that Uyghur militants had already left Afghanistan and would be granted no haven in the country now that the Taliban are in control. The prevention of the use of Afghanistan as a training and recruitment center for Uyghur or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/taliban-terrorist-jihadi-american-inventory/\">Islamist militants</a>&nbsp;is Beijing&rsquo;s top priority for the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Beijing&rsquo;s renewed diplomacy comes despite a lack of significant interests in the country and minimal historical leverage over Kabul. Moreover, China has an inherent policy bias against entanglements overseas. Although this is being tested by the country&rsquo;s growing overseas interests, there remains a restriction on intensive foreign engagements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, for Beijing it may be less its relationship with Kabul, and more its relationship with Islamabad, that proves more useful in its Afghan policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For its part, Kabul certainly sees the benefits of wooing Beijing. When the Taliban were first in power in 1996-2001, China was a major regional economic power but far from being the global one it is now. Rapid growth over the past 20 years, facilitated by the country&rsquo;s entry into the World Trade Organization, has meant that China is now a potentially lucrative trade partner, investment source and defense contractor for Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But China&rsquo;s economic interests in Afghanistan are still very limited. Trade is minimal &ndash; reaching $550 million in 2020, a tiny fraction of China&rsquo;s $5 trillion worth of total trade that year. A single flagship&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/vietnam-us-vice-president-factory-afghanistan/\">investment project</a>&nbsp;exists &ndash; the $4 billion copper mine in Mes Aynak &ndash; but has failed to progress despite agreements being signed in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are now signs that Beijing might be eager to restart the languishing project, the instability of the Taliban government and continued insecurity in Afghanistan raise risks. ISIS-Khorasan has already demonstrated its willingness and ability to launch attacks on international targets, after setting off a deadly strike at Kabul airport in late August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-state violence is already a concern for Beijing in its investments in neighboring Pakistan, where the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, an arm of the Belt and Road Initiative, has attracted attacks on Chinese citizens and pipelines. Despite the strategic benefits of investment in Afghanistan, there is likely to be wariness to engage deeply in one of the world&rsquo;s least stable countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But another option exists. As in the 1990s, Beijing might prefer to utilize the much greater influence held by its ally, Pakistan, as a proxy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Afghan-Pakistani ties are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/pakistan-taliban-afghanistan-blowback/\">complex and often riven with mistrust</a>, Islamabad&rsquo;s support for the Taliban provides a level of access and influence unrivalled among state actors. Demonstrating this fact, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, director-general of Pakistan&rsquo;s Inter-Services Intelligence agency, visited Kabul in early September to meet the Taliban leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pakistan has its own ambitions in Afghanistan, particularly the curbing of the Pakistani Taliban, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which resides in Afghanistan. It would be simple for Beijing to suggest to Pakistan that it should add Uyghur militants to its list of groups it wants eradicated. Similar pressure was exerted in the 1990s, leading eventually to a Pakistani operation in 2003 to kill the then head of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, Hasan Mahsum, near the Afghan border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China has already attempted to instrumentalize Pakistan&rsquo;s leverage with Kabul through trilateral diplomacy. The first trilateral strategic dialogue between the three neighbors was held in 2015; the fourth iteration of the event was held in June 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the Taliban now in power, and Pakistan&rsquo;s influence seemingly greater, such forums could prove even more useful. But Beijing&rsquo;s proxy diplomacy is likely to proceed quietly and with less publicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China remains wary of rushing in to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/us-failure-afghanistan-recognize-taliban/\">support the Taliban</a>. Although it desires stability on its doorstep, the Taliban have yet to prove themselves able to govern, and particularly to rein in powerful autonomous non-state groups such as the Haqqani network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the more reason, then, for Beijing to try to garner its influence through Islamabad. For China, it is an attractive policy &ndash; keeping its hands clean while attempting to foster stability in a country that has seen more than 40 years of continuous war. The question is, what will Pakistan seek to extract out of its role?</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638163033.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'chinas-afghanistan-policy-runs-through-pakistan', '', '2021-11-29 10:47:13', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(147, 4, 11, 'Let The Market Solve Climate Change', NULL, NULL, '<p>Our approach to climate change and curbing carbon emissions is broken. Let&rsquo;s face it: Governments and international organizations have so far failed to alter the trajectory of our warming planet. This isn&rsquo;t for lack of trying, but the sad reality is that governments and international organizations haven&rsquo;t been able to curb the global market&rsquo;s appetite for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/renewable-energy-emerging-markets/?swcfpc=1\">fossil fuels</a>. Yet, there is an obvious and potentially lucrative way out of this mess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to altering this imbalance is through the market itself. The technology underpinning clean and renewable energy is accelerating exponentially, with costs plunging through the floor. As a result of these developments, clean energy will soon be cheaper across every metric than traditional fossil fuels. Since these trends are happening by the forces of the market alone, the best thing that governments can do is meaningfully invest in climate technology infrastructure and companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s decision to curb carbon emissions to net-zero by 2060 is welcome news. Still, the real opportunity of the Kingdom&rsquo;s pledge remains unrealized. As one of the world&rsquo;s leading producers of hydrocarbons, Saudi Arabia wields incredible influence over global carbon emissions through its ability to curtail oil production. A dramatic shift in oil production isn&rsquo;t realistic because the world is still dependent on fossil fuels. The market won&rsquo;t allow it at this stage but things are changing fast. When it&rsquo;s cheaper and easier to get electricity from solar energy and drive an electric car, there won&rsquo;t be much room left for fossil fuels. Along with other leading countries in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia has a unique opportunity to invest in this future of energy while transforming the regional knowledge economy by following these historic announcements with substantial investments into climate technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The path forward is not about simply cutting emissions or planting trees but committed investment in climate technology. Larry Fink, the CEO of hedge fund Blackrock, recently said that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-next-1000-unicorns-will-be-in-climate-tech.html\" target=\"_blank\">next 1,000 unicorn startups worth at least $1bn</a>&nbsp;would be involved in climate technology. Moreover, international organizations need to ensure that capital is invested in climate technology in developing nations. Not only is the market exploding, but there is significant room for governments to help direct the energy to emerging and developing nations. Given the Gulf&rsquo;s strong connections with emerging market countries in Africa, the subcontinent, and Asia, it is perfectly positioned to be an exporter of climate technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clean energy will be universal at some point in the near future, and that&rsquo;s one reason for Fink&rsquo;s optimism. Current market and technology trends suggest that it could take shape much sooner than we realize. Consider the price of solar energy as an example of how fast the market is changing. Over the last decade, the price of electricity from utility-scale solar projects has dropped by a factor of five. That equates to an 80% price decline. This remarkable drop means that building a new solar plant is cost-competitive with new coal or gas power plants. What&rsquo;s even more impressive is that costs are falling so fast that they are outpacing forecasts. Solar electricity in 2020 is roughly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.exponentialview.co/the-exponential-march-of-solar-energy/\" target=\"_blank\">a quarter</a>&nbsp;the price the International Energy Agency projected in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The market will render fossil fuels obsolete. The question is how long this shift will take and whether we have the time to wait. The forces are already taking shape as the market is course-correcting through deeper adoption of renewable energy. Just look at the skyrocketing share price of Telsa and the explosion in global electric vehicle sales. There are examples of the shift everywhere. Governments can accelerate this transition with intelligent policy investment in climate technology and (hopefully) stave off dire climate change forecasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where the Gulf could potentially step in. Leading Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already laid out ambitious green energy goals. Saudi Arabia plans to build the world&rsquo;s largest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-firm-unveils-worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-project\" target=\"_blank\">green hydrogen plant powered by wind and solar energy</a>&nbsp;in the city of Neom. Long-term projects are good targets, but smaller-scale investments in startups now can be the catalyst for real change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the capital to invest and the ideal conditions for research and development, Gulf states are positioned to support the next generation of climate technology startups. These aren&rsquo;t limited to renewable energy projects but can focus on agricultural technology, smart city development, and green hydrogen energy. Not only are such investments valuable for the global fight against climate change, but they are critical for building the strength of the region&rsquo;s knowledge economy. Moreover, the Gulf can export such technology to emerging market countries around the world. When Cape Town, South Africa, nearly ran out of water in 2018, the UAE was close to exporting desalination technology to ease the crisis. That&rsquo;s a specific example of how the Gulf could spread its climate-related industry across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government pledges to curb carbon emissions are significant, but they aren&rsquo;t enough. The industrial revolution and the triumph of resource-hungry capitalism are a big reason we are facing climate challenges. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we need to embrace the mechanism of capitalism to foster real change in the hydrocarbon industry and the transition to renewables.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638163139.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'let-the-market-solve-climate-change', '', '2021-11-29 10:48:59', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(148, 4, 11, 'How Wildfires in Turkey Decimated the Honey Industry', NULL, NULL, '<p>The start of September in Turkey&rsquo;s western coastal regions is usually a busy one for beekeepers. It marks the first harvest of the season of the region&rsquo;s famous pine honey. This occurs when the beehives are moved from the higher plains inland, where they are placed during the summer, to the forests nearer the coasts. This year, however, wildfires&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/turkey-forest-fire-conspiracy/\">destroyed</a>&nbsp;vast swaths of Turkey&rsquo;s pine trees, wiping out a centuries-old industry. Not only has the devastation destroyed a rich part of Turkey&rsquo;s heritage, it has also brought down pressure on president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party that has long been accused of favoring sweeping development projects over conserving Turkey&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/turkey-environment-failure/\">natural environment</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wildfires started in late July and in just two weeks destroyed 160,000 hectares of forest and killed eight people.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/erdogan-wastes-turkeys-geographic-position-of-influence/\">Erdogan&rsquo;s government</a>&nbsp;was widely criticized for the poor response that allowed the blazes to rage through coastal towns, destroying homes. While the government has promised to rebuild, it is less likely they will attempt to replant the pine trees, which were essential for the bees to produce the world-renowned pine honey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The red pine tree forests damaged by the fires stretch from the eastern Mediterranean coast all the way to the northern Aegean Sea. The quality of the honey is down to the Marchalina Hellenica insect that feed on the trees&rsquo; sap. Bees collect the insects&rsquo; secretions and whisk the honeydew away to the hives to make honey. More than 90 percent of the world&rsquo;s pine honey came from Turkey and most of that was produced in Mugla province in the southwest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each autumn, beekeepers would place around 3.5 million hives in the province&rsquo;s forests, with 2.5 million of the hives brought in from outside Mugla. The loss of 66,000 hectares of forest to the fires has brought an immediate end to honey production in Mugla. Up to 10,000 beekeepers used to harvest more than 20,000 tonnes of honey from Mugla, but now their livelihood is gone. It will take decades for new trees to reach the necessary maturity to be inhabited by the Marchalina Hellenica insect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mugla is not the only region affected. Towns such as Osmaniye, Bayir and Turgut, where honey is one of the main industries, have also suffered a similar fate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The forestry ministry has handed out funds to the beekeepers to keep them afloat. Samil Tuncay Bestoy, the head of the Environment and Bee Protection Association, painted a bleak picture of the future, however. He believes it will be almost impossible to keep the bee colonies alive. &ldquo;A slow death awaits them,&rdquo; he said. Unlike farm animals, bees cannot be fed, they survive off the forest ecosystem. According to Huseyin Sengul, president of the Izmir Beekeeping Association, it will take 50 years for Turkey&rsquo;s pine tree honey to return to the same standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fires will also knock Turkey down the pecking order of global honey producers. In 2020, it was the second largest, producing more than 110,000 tonnes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is now critical that ecologists with expertise in forest management are brought into these areas to help the trees regrow. Sadly, the government lacks this capacity. Moreover, its response to the fires in general has demonstrated that it is unwilling to listen to experts. Of even more concern for the residents of Mugla is the suggestion that the government may take advantage of the recently scorched earth to open a series of mines in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2018, mining licenses have been granted for large areas of what was once forest &ndash; a far more permanent threat to the ecosystem than the summer&rsquo;s fires. Such a move would fit with Erdogan&rsquo;s track record of large-scale projects running roughshod over the environment.

(149, 4, 11, 'When It Comes to Renewable Energy in Emerging Markets, It’s All About the Basics', NULL, NULL, '<p>As the technology improves and prices fall for renewable energy, more countries in emerging markets are hoping to go&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/saudi-arabias-path-toward-solar-energy/\">green</a>. China and the United States, in particular, are vying for influence in these markets. But both miscalculate what is needed. This gap in understanding reveals just how challenging the transition to renewable energy will be. For in fact, the path to widespread adoption of green energy in developing countries lies as much in upgrades to &ndash; and the not-very-sexy matter of &ndash; transmission infrastructure, which has long been overlooked, as it does in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/climate-change-nuclear-energy/\">sustainable power generation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is leading the push into renewable energy in the Middle East and Africa with a flurry of partnerships and ventures with key players in the clean-energy sector. The state-owned China Three Gorges Corporation, for example, recently acquired Dubai-based wind and solar developer Alcazar Energy Partners. The deal, estimated to be worth $500 million, will give China a significant foothold in the Middle East clean-energy sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, China rightly senses that there is a good deal of money to be made from developing countries&rsquo; hunger for green-energy innovation. Consider China&rsquo;s recent partnership with Egypt&rsquo;s El Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company to test Chinese-made electric vehicles. El Nasr is importing electric cars from China&rsquo;s Dongfeng Motor Corporation to kickstart a joint venture that will eventually see Dongfeng&rsquo;s vehicles assembled in Egypt. For now, it&rsquo;s a small program involving testing cars in cooperation with Uber. But given that Egypt is the second-largest car market in the Middle East, after Saudi Arabia, it is understandable why Dongfeng would be interested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is, however, one caveat. Anyone who knows anything about Egypt will wonder how a fleet of privately-owned&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/electric-cars-may-salve-our-conscience-but-without-renewable-energy-they-could-be-as-much-an-ecological-disaster/\">electric cars</a>, not just those from Dongfeng and not just those supplied to Uber, will be juiced up. Charging stations all over Cairo? Hard to imagine. But hold on, there&rsquo;s more to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For its part, the US government is exiting support for carbon-intensive energy infrastructure projects worldwide. Earlier this year, the Biden administration decided to draw down American funding for carbon-intensive initiatives. Joe Biden&rsquo;s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told the US Development Finance Corporation that limiting aid to high-carbon-energy infrastructure projects would be a powerful means of addressing the climate crisis and would help drive investment toward climate solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the surface, this sounds prudent. Who could disagree? On deeper reflection, however, the emphasis on high-tech generation also means neglect in investment for more prosaic elements of the energy-supply matrix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That issue is the transmission and distribution infrastructure. Take Africa. Generally, the continent lacks a robust and extensive grid system. It is one thing to say that there will be an emphasis on the green-generation side, but what about how to distribute the power that is produced? Reports put the number of people lacking access to electricity on the continent at as high as 600 million. That&rsquo;s more than the population of North and Central America together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the American and Chinese approaches reveal a lack of understanding of what markets need to go green. Taking stakes in major clean-energy projects and testing electric vehicles on the streets of Cairo sounds terrific, but neither will kickstart a green-energy revolution if power can&rsquo;t be transmitted across individual countries. Indeed, how will charging stations for electric cars even get their power? And frankly, without a concomitant dedication to building transmission and distribution networks, plans for green-electric generation will be stillborn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worse, it threatens to aggravate the developed-developing world divide. In the West and Asia, governments and industry are rushing to build out green-power generation while mandating electrification of cars in 20-30 years. Places like Africa, however, will continue to be dependent on the internal combustion engine well beyond 2050. And as leading car manufacturers in Asia, Europe and North America pivot increasingly toward electric vehicles, that means the average age of fossil-fuel powered cars in Africa will eventually rise. Notably, older cars are more polluting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The developing world, and especially Africa, needs basic infrastructure in the form of better electric grid systems, in addition to high-tech green-power generation. For the very foundation of the power grid is damaged in many countries, which means renewable energy projects will never get going at scale. For if&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/south-africa-renewable-energy/\">South Africa</a>, the continent&rsquo;s most industrialized nation, struggles with the basics of power infrastructure, imagine the situation in Chad or Mali. Thus, if the US and China are serious about renewable energy &ndash; for both anti-climate-change and commercial reasons &ndash; they must start by building the basics of the electricity infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With population numbers in emerging markets set to explode over the coming decades and the risk of climate-related disasters on the rise, time is running out. Failing to fully address the needs of the Global South will erode any gains made in the developed North. The leading economies of the world should see their interest mirrored in that of poorer nations.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638163324.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'when-it-comes-to-renewable-energy-in-emerging-markets-its-all-about-the-basics', '', '2021-11-29 10:52:04', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Moscow has been hoping to set up a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/russia-naval-base-sudan/\">naval base</a>&nbsp;in the northeast African nation, in the middle of the southern shore of the Red Sea, but Khartoum turned out to be a much tougher negotiator than the Kremlin expected &ndash; though, only after the fact. However, Khartoum may have bitten off more than it can chew. The Russian bear isn&rsquo;t going to back down so easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In late 2020, Moscow announced plans to open a port in Sudan, giving Russia its first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/port-sudan-russia-great-game/\">military foothold in Africa</a>&nbsp;since the fall of the Soviet Union. The two countries reached a deal that would give Russia&rsquo;s navy a 25-year lease at Port Sudan. The facility would host up to four navy ships and 300 military personnel, in exchange for weapons and military equipment for Khartoum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Sudan now has second thoughts. According to Russian media, Khartoum wants to renegotiate the deal. It will now allow Russia to build the naval base, officially described as a &ldquo;material-technical support facility,&rdquo; only if the Kremlin also provides economic assistance. More importantly, it will let the Russian navy stay only five years, with a possibility to extend the lease up to a total of the 25 years originally agreed. For Russia, that would constitute a large investment for no great certainty of tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sudan wants to amend the agreement before the country&rsquo;s parliament formally ratifies the deal that had been agreed to. Russia has not yet officially responded to the proposal. The Kremlin has, however, through its think-tanks and analysts, indicated that it is not willing to go along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if the Kremlin, faced with this new demand from Khartoum, gives up on its plans to open the naval base, it would be interpreted as another Russian geopolitical defeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, if Russia were to agree to the new terms, there is no guarantee that Khartoum would not come up with new demands. It would also set up a precedent for Russia&rsquo;s other partners around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, the chief of staff of the Sudanese armed forces announced the revision of the agreement signed by his country and Russia, and soon after that Sudan&rsquo;s defense minister visited Moscow to discuss the fate of the port. In July, Sudan&rsquo;s foreign minister, Mariam Al-Mahdi, openly hinted that the future of the base would largely depend on a &ldquo;positive solution to a number of issues on which Khartoum counts on Moscow&rsquo;s understanding and support.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the US reportedly offered a multimillion-dollar aid package to Khartoum in exchange for canceling the deal with Moscow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sudan, obviously needs financial help. The government had hoped to attract foreign investment after Washington removed Sudan from its list of states supporting terrorism &ndash; but this has not yet yielded dividend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, it may be trying to determine the best outcome for itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kremlin, for its part, has at least three options. First, it could provide the economic assistance that Sudan now wants included in the deal. Or it could simply say &ldquo;nyet&rdquo; and walk away. Finally, Moscow could try to pressure the Sudanese and indirectly force them to reach a compromise. Russia&rsquo;s trump card in the latter scenario might be neighboring Ethiopia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, during Al-Mahdi&rsquo;s visit to Moscow, she expressed hopes that Russia could convince Ethiopia to compromise regarding the future of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/water-war-horn-africa/\">Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam</a>&nbsp;(GERD) &ndash; a hydroelectric power project under construction on the Blue Nile. Tensions between Sudan and Ethiopia over the GERD&rsquo;s water rights, Ethiopian farmers&rsquo; use of a fertile border region claimed by Sudan, as well as a decades-old border dispute between the two countries, have threatened to turn into full-scale confrontation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, during the 2019 Russia-Africa summit in Sochi, Vladimir Putin had spoken about &ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s capabilities&rdquo; to assist in the settlement of the dispute if required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, one calculation is that resolving the dispute would be of a higher value to the Sudanese than any economic aid they might manage to squeeze out of Moscow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Moscow&rsquo;s leverage can work both ways. On September 4, Sudan discovered and seized 72 boxes of Russian weapons on an Ethiopian Airlines plane that arrived in Khartoum. Local authorities characterized the arms as intended for use in &ldquo;crimes against the state, impeding the democratic transition and preventing the transition to [a] civil state.&rdquo; The weapons apparently were originally shipped from Russia to Ethiopia in 2019. Speculations are that the fact that the weapons were on a commercial flight, and thus easily &ldquo;discovered,&rdquo; could be a message to Sudan to get serious about its original commitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officials from the foreign ministries of Russia and Sudan are scheduled to meet on September 21.

(151, 4, 11, 'Gulf Oil Producers Are Investing in Hydrogen. It Won’t Be Enough to Replace Fossil Fuel', NULL, NULL, '<p>As the world accelerates its transition to renewable energy from fossil fuel, oil and gas producers in the Middle East face a defining moment: How to pivot away from an economy still heavily dependent on fossil fuel? One option is to see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/gulf-oil-carbon-neutrality/\">green transition</a>&nbsp;as an opportunity. A strategy to come out of this, and which has been much talked about lately, is to leverage gas reserves and ample sunlight into the production of hydrogen gas. But caveat venditor, so to speak. With the industry and market for sustainable products fundamentally different from that for fossil fuel, there is no certainty that oil and gas can be entirely substituted by &ldquo;green molecules.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, oil and natural gas prices are comfortably high from the perspective of exporters. Conventional wisdom would imply that there is little incentive to increase investments in alternatives. According to the International Energy Agency, global oil demand will reach pre-pandemic levels before the end of this year. Demand, furthermore, is likely to grow in the coming years. However, that hasn&rsquo;t comforted Gulf producers who look at a horizon beyond the medium term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the one hand, the current fleet of cars and power plants will indeed see higher utilization of fossil fuel as economic activity rebounds from a Covid-19 induced slowdown. But decarbonization is happening at such a great speed that we will likely see much of current fossil-fuel reserves left in the ground, with demand in the further horizon being mostly from poorer countries unable to make the investment in sustainable-energy production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EU&rsquo;s Green Deal aims for the bloc to have no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, and its European Commission recently proposed policies aimed at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by the end of the decade. The US is negotiating a wide-ranging infrastructure bill that, if it passes anywhere near its current form, will radically reduce its dependence on fossil fuel. Next, China has pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2060. And then there are the smaller economies of East Asia, from Singapore to Taiwan and South Korea and all the way up to Japan. Thus, demand for Middle East oil and gas, particularly from Europe and East Asia, will be sharply reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as importantly, the transition to sustainable energy is a demand-side development. Whereas Opec and non-Opec oil producers hold the levers to oil prices (though much less so today than in the 1970s), it is end users of sustainable energy that will dictate the fortunes of suppliers. Thus, the demand side is shaping the long-term industrial policies of today&rsquo;s fossil-fuel producers. Indeed, from the current perspective, it would seem eminently sensible for fossil-fuel producers to use their resources &ndash; which would otherwise offer diminishing returns &ndash; to supply green-energy needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Gulf region, substantial natural-gas reserves are an opportunity to produce &ldquo;blue hydrogen&rdquo; derived from methane. In this process, methane is separated into hydrogen and carbon, and the latter then is captured and stored. In addition, the sparsely populated deserts of the region are ideal for massive solar farms to generate electricity that can be used for &ldquo;yellow hydrogen&rdquo; production through the electrolysis of water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, the UAE has invested in a strategy focused on blue hydrogen. Oman&rsquo;s main goal is its future green hydrogen factory in Al Wusta governorate, worth $31 billion. Saudi Arabia plans to invest $5 billion in the futuristic city, NEOM, in the northwest to produce &ldquo;green hydrogen&rdquo; from both wind- and solar-powered electrolysis by 2025.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it is unlikely that hydrogen will be a substitute entirely for the oil and gas industry of the Gulf region due to three reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the level of import dependence in end-user countries is uncertain. While there is a necessity for imported oil and gas, the scale of imports for hydrogen is uncertain as it can be produced anywhere as long as there is electricity. The possibility of the revival of the nuclear industry to power electrolysis for the production of &ldquo;pink hydrogen&rdquo; cannot be completely discounted (nor for that matter that nuclear-powered electricity will obviate the need for hydrogen in the first place). For while fossil fuel is geology dependent, hydrogen is technology driven. Recall that, after all, hydrogen is the most plentiful element in the universe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the Gulf region does not have a monopoly on climate suitable for green hydrogen. Countries such as Chile, Australia and Spain, to name some, are lining up to become exporters of hydrogen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, Russia&rsquo;s Gazprom and Rosatom intend to repurpose the extended pipeline infrastructure with Europe to export blue and pink hydrogen in the near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, while oil and gas will inevitably become less valuable, there is no certainty that alternative forms of energy from the Gulf&rsquo;s current fossil-fuel producers can offer as much value on an industry basis. It is for this reason that large Gulf oil producers have sought to pump as much oil as possible today to stock up sovereign wealth funds, while concurrently investigating various forms of economic diversification. In this scenario, hydrogen &ndash; which has captured the imagination of many &ndash; is only one strategy in an arsenal that will require many elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was never useful to try to understand the Middle East mostly through the lens of oil; it will be equally fruitless to do so through the hype over hydrogen.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638163479.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'gulf-oil-producers-are-investing-in-hydrogen-it-wont-be-enough-to-replace-fossil-fuel', '', '2021-11-29 10:54:39', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

Saied clearly prefers that political power be centralized. He has created all the conditions for that as he froze parliament &ldquo;till further notice&rdquo; and did not appoint a prime minister despite promising to name one within &ldquo;days.&rdquo; In short, it does not appear that Saied intends to relinquish or delegate power anytime soon. But how he uses that power will depend on his yet-to-be-disclosed plans and how well he can continue to satisfy the various constituencies in Tunisia&rsquo;s political circles and civil society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, there is no viable alternative to the system he has put in place, nor a competing power to him. Saied has replaced cabinet members with aplomb. He has received officials and foreign dignitaries and engaged them without the intermediation of aides, leaving no doubt who is in charge. Videos of his speeches, which are posted on social media, have become the main source of daily news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His current status is bolstered by three factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, he is popular. Although some of his more recent decisions have sparked objections and criticism from a number of political parties and civil society groups, Saied enjoys broad public support. An opinion poll conducted in mid-August showed his favorability rating at more than 90 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The changed landscape is seen as a relief from the days of parliamentary impasse and chronic bickering, a trademark of the now-eclipsed political order. Those who object to his indefinite extension of the &ldquo;state of exception&rdquo; and his de facto dissolution of the national assembly are for now in the minority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, he enjoys support from the military. There is no doubt that Saied could have implemented the emergency measures without the unequivocal support of the armed forces, whose role was decisive in preventing any outbreak of violence. Since then, he has prioritized naming a senior presidential security corps officer as minister of interior. He has wasted no opportunity to highlight his trust in the military, whether in carrying out their regular duties or in managing the Covid-19 health crisis. He even appointed an army doctor as minister of health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, he enjoys either support or forbearance by the international community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most conspicuous expressions of foreign support for Saied have come from Arab Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia. Relations with Turkey and, to a lesser extent, Qatar, foreign backers of the Islamist political party Ennahda, have been cool to frosty. Saied has not seemed to mind their lack of full support. This is a clear reflection of the regional polarization over political Islam. In between the two camps, Algeria has established itself as the watchful &ldquo;big sister.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The West, for its part, is in a wait-and-see mode. The US and European states have weighed the popular backing for Saied and are wary of public sensitivity to any perception of Western interference in Tunisia&rsquo;s domestic affairs. Thus, while Washington and European capitals have reiterated calls for a commitment to the democratic process, it is telling that a visiting senior US delegation in August signaled a desire to err on the side of prudence. Overall, Saied seems to have been granted time to flesh out his plans for the future of democracy, while dealing with the exigent demands of the country&rsquo;s myriad crises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, a 90 percent favorability rating can be dragged down fast by gravity, and forbearance can erode quickly, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is, to be sure, already some frustration &ndash; even among Saied&rsquo;s supporters &ndash; over a lack of clarity about his larger goals and for his marginalization of many stakeholders, including friendly political parties and the powerful trade unions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frustratingly for his allies, Saied has refused to pin himself to any precise &ldquo;roadmap,&rdquo; vowing only that there will be no return to the status quo ante. He has said that his politics will follow &ldquo;the will of the people.&rdquo; But what that actually means remains to be seen. Perhaps this might take the form of a referendum on constitutional and electoral changes that would crystallize his preference for an executive president and &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; representation. But all this could take many more months to come to fruition, if at all. Meanwhile, uncertainty rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tunisia definitely needs change. Despite all the promises made by successive governments in the last decade, there would only be a series of deepening social and economic crises. Consequently, Tunisians know exactly the type of political system they do not want. But they are waiting for Saied to suggest the shape of an alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Saied&rsquo;s ad hoc decrees have been accepted by the population, it remains to be seen if these decrees can address the many daunting challenges the country faces. From a larger perspective, the public is eager to discover how his future initiatives can satisfy &ldquo;the will of the people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The test of whether Saied can maintain his power base will hinge on the tangible changes he will introduce while preserving freedoms. He might come to discover that being in sole possession of all the levers makes him increasingly vulnerable to criticism. He might find that he has to make compromises and engage with political parties and civil society groups, which he has kept thus far at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for now, his most urgent task is to dispel the mist around his decision making, and show he can effectively steer the ship of state to safe harbor. The country is willing to wait for Saied to deliver. As all the governments since 2011 know, Tunisians want a positive turn to their fortune.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638163617.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'tunisians-want-to-know-where-kais-saied-is-taking-the-country', '', '2021-11-29 10:56:57', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Even historians of Afghanistan&rsquo;s brutal civil war must be surprised, however, at quite how similar it appears to be to the past, and the speed with which names from the 1990s have reappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a warlord whose militia indiscriminately shelled the capital in the 1990s and who was only allowed to return to the country three years ago, joining a council that may run the country, sitting alongside the former president, Hamid Karzai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is Abdul Rashid Dostum, a notorious Afghan warlord whose forces have been accused of numerous crimes, now seeking a national role alongside the Taliban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And here is Ahmad Massoud, the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, a pro-US warlord, though a warlord nonetheless, whose militia opposed the Taliban when they were in power, returning to Afghanistan and writing fluid op-eds for the Washington Post quoting Roosevelt and asking Americans for more weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the grubby business of sudden realignment. Victory and defeat have created strange bedfellows. As politicians, militias and countries urgently seek new allies, they appear willing to tolerate almost any amount of whitewashing of history just to remain relevant. No one is immune to this grubbiness, not the Americans, not the outside world, nor even the Taliban themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a matter of days, the US was forced to negotiate with the foe they spent 20 years fighting, just to get their personnel out of the airport safely. From being the cause of instability, the Taliban were reconstituted as the &ldquo;good guys,&rdquo; trying to stop ISIS bombers getting through. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything to convince me [the Taliban] let it happen,&rdquo; said the head of the US Central Command, of the Kabul airport attack that killed Afghan civilians and American soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Western media, a narrative of good vs evil continues, even as the &ldquo;Resistance&rdquo; to the Taliban calls for more war, endless war &ndash; the precise reason many Afghans gave for letting the Taliban walk unopposed into their cities, just to end the conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a curious way, this grubby search for allies is more problematic for the West and the Taliban than it is for Afghanistan&rsquo;s neighbors, because both seek a level of moral consistency to their actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the West, there is a moral and political dimension to their alliances: it still matters for Western politicians to be seen to deal with &ldquo;morally pure&rdquo; actors, and thus the only way to make alliances with problematic groups &ndash; which, frankly, after decades of brutal conflict includes almost everyone significant in Afghanistan &ndash; is to downplay or ignore those crimes. The political dimension is especially complex, because no Western government whose citizens died in combat can afford even the merest appearance that those sacrifices were in vain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Taliban, too, need to demonstrate a certain ideological purity, especially after fighting the West for so long &ndash; they, too, have lost comrades and need to demonstrate to their followers it wasn&rsquo;t in vain. Yet they will also be acutely aware of the precariousness of their victory. Afghanistan has billions of dollars squirrelled away abroad and the Taliban will need access to banking networks to get hold of it. Taliban representatives have already indicated they want genuine international recognition, with embassies and diplomats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get it, they will need to prize open their opaque, centralized power structure and their, perhaps more opaque, religious teachings. They will have to share power, at least nominally, and with people they have tried to hurt. One such figure is the former president, Hamid Karzai, to whom they may be forced to offer a role &ndash; the same Karzai whose brother the Taliban murdered and publicly celebrated doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one will come out of these compromises clean. Even those who ostensibly won the war are scrambling to ensure they don&rsquo;t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Pakistan, it is one thing to have, as in the 1990s, a pariah Islamist group in charge next door. It is quite another to have an Islamist group that have just thrown out the superpower in charge and be accepted internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Pakistan, the best outcome is a Taliban government operating just below the threshold of global respectability, so Kabul will always need Islamabad. The worst is a Taliban state whose conservatism could motivate Pakistanis, and whose defeat of the US can be contrasted unfavorably with Islamabad&rsquo;s more pliant position. And so, mere days after an ally took power in Kabul, Pakistan will need to seek out grubby anti-Taliban alliances in order to contain their power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defeat makes realists of everyone, but in Afghanistan even the winners must compromise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The necessity of dealing with the reality of the Taliban within the international community while appearing to stay true to values once espoused, means whitewashing crimes on all sides.

But the similarity ends with the images and the human suffering they represent. The shallow comparison is a false premise to draw any political conclusions. The people who sought to flee Vietnam were attempting to escape an authoritarian political future, while the Afghans fear plunging back to a dark past. The Vietnamese communist government&rsquo;s modernization plan eventually included a large role for America; not so for any intentions involving the medieval theologians of the Taliban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, the Saigonese initially feared that the conservative communist rulers would impose cultural austerity. Black cotton pajama pants would replace the popular denim jeans; nail polish and lipstick, among other such things, would disappear. But soon the Saigonese were mocking the country-bumpkin soldiers. They found North Vietnam&rsquo;s communists envied South Vietnam&rsquo;s lifestyle and wanted it for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, Vietnam&rsquo;s modernization plan counted on massive amounts of US aid and an economy based on modern technology. Indeed, in the first three years after its victory, Hanoi desperately sought to establish diplomatic relations with America. For while Vietnamese strategists relished their historic victory over the US, they understood that the real long-term threat to their security came instead from China, across the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They knew their history. For much of the first millennium of the common era, China ruled Vietnam. The next thousand years were marked by repeated Chinese attempts to reestablish control over the country. Vietnamese leaders expected Washington to get over its humiliation of defeat and to appreciate Vietnam&rsquo;s traditional role, which Richard Nixon once defined as &ldquo;a cork in the bottle of Chinese expansionism.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But seduced by the idea of a modernizing China, Jimmy Carter and his national security advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, embraced Deng Xiaoping&rsquo;s China as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. It was no surprise that Hanoi then turned to Moscow when faced with imminent threat by the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, which led to a decade of debilitating conflict between the two Indochinese states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fall of the Soviet Union reshuffled American interests. Now, it needed a strategic counter to China, and the value of Vietnam became apparent. There can be no better, continuing illustration of that than US vice president Kamala Harris&rsquo;s visit to Vietnam as America&rsquo;s presence in Afghanistan crumbled. While in Hanoi, she urged Vietnam, the very country that drove the US out 46 years ago, to embrace strategic relations with the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Taliban set up a red line for American departure, the Vietnamese were at first relieved to see the Americans go, but then just as keen to welcome them back as economic and intergovernmental partners. This year, Intel boosted its investment in Vietnam by half a billion dollars, on top of its initial outlay of $1 billion in 2006. Coca-Cola first began to invest in Vietnam in 1994, and today its products are everywhere in the country. And on August 25, vice president Harris opened in Hanoi the Southeast Asia regional office of the US Centers for Disease Control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Taliban continue their brutal policy &ndash; it is wishful thinking to imagine otherwise &ndash; I was reminded of a very different experience in Saigon in 1975, where I served as a correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 1 that year, I was pondering breakfast after a series of sleepless nights and adrenalin-fueled days of reporting &ndash; my dispatch the previous day was the last by a foreign journalist before the North Vietnamese cut the telex line to the outside world. There was a knock on the door. Outside my apartment stood a green-uniformed Vietnamese soldier &ndash; known as bodoi &ndash; with a large handgun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Startled, I let him in so he could check that I wasn&rsquo;t harboring any old-regime soldier. He was clearly disappointed and embarrassed. But I could not fail to notice his wistful look at the eggs and bread on my kitchen counter. He readily agreed to my invitation for breakfast. While my unexpected guest, the dreaded Vietcong, put down his gun and heartily tucked into an omelet, I showed him the latest issue of my magazine, which I&rsquo;d recently received from Hong Kong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortuitously, the cover image showed Chinese communist leaders against the backdrop of a large painting of Vladimir Lenin. The young Vietcong could not recognize Mao or Zhou Enlai, but suddenly spotted Lenin and excitedly repeated, &ldquo;Le-nin, Le-nin.&rdquo; He left clasping both my hands in thanks. Even in the enemy lair of Saigon he thought he had found a comrade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am reminded of this story as I read about the Taliban looking for infidels in house-to-house searches. Nothing could show the difference between the enemies the US faced in Afghanistan and Vietnam more clearly than the attitude of all three to intellectual history. America is guided by John Locke, Vietnam, at least formally, by Hegel through Marx; both countries may argue about the contours of freedom, but both are dedicated to giving their people a form of modernity. The Taliban, however, want to return to an Arabian past going back some 1,400 years. What followed the communist victory in Vietnam, and what is likely to ensue now that the Taliban have triumphed, stem from this fundamental difference.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638163735.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'fall-of-kabul-vietnam-just-welcomed-the-us-vice-president-but-will-the-taliban-ever-host-an-american-factory-in-afghanistan', '', '2021-11-29 10:58:55', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(155, 4, 10, 'Booster Shots Won’t Stop the Next Covid-19 Variant', NULL, NULL, '<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/renaming-covid-variants-fight-racism/\">delta variant</a>&nbsp;of Covid-19 is wreaking havoc around the world and wealthy countries are deploying booster shots as a defense. With remarkable speed, the United States has pushed forward a plan to offer a third vaccination jab as an attempt to curb the spread within its borders. This response is hardly surprising, but given how many countries are still struggling to get a single dose of vaccine to a significant segment of their populations, the move ignores the long-term threat from vast global disparities in immunity. Plus, the emergence of the mu variant, and behind it C.1.2, further calls into question the prudence of booster shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best strategy for eradicating the delta variant &ndash; and the other variants waiting in the wings &ndash; isn&rsquo;t booster shots in rich countries, but a worldwide vaccination program that gets as many people as possible fully jabbed. Such a program should focus on local manufacturing of vaccines to ensure poorer countries are empowered by the ability to produce the jabs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization&rsquo;s health emergency program, recently compared booster shots to handing out life jackets to people already wearing them. The WHO has been unusually vocal in its opposition to third jabs by calling for a moratorium until the vaccine gap between rich and poor countries closes. The vaccine doses lined up as boosters should be sent to countries where many have not even had a single jab. This is even more urgent considering most booster recipients already have enough protection to avoid hospitalization and death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American officials say booster shots won&rsquo;t interfere with vaccination drives worldwide. Jeff Zients, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said the US donates twice as many vaccine doses as it uses. But he fails to answer why it could not donate more by not promoting booster shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the US Food and Drug Administration has fully authorized the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, the ratio Zients mentions is bound to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authorization prompted several large institutions, from the US army to the government of New York state, to pass vaccine mandates for their staff. Coupled with the push for booster shots, the US is about to embark on another massive vaccination drive that will last well into next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel, one of the most vaccinated countries, on August 29 expanded its booster campaign to everyone aged 12 and over. More than 60 percent of the country&rsquo;s population is fully vaccinated. This compares to Egypt, for example, where the figure is less than 3 percent. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, described third jab availability as &ldquo;a privilege that no other country has&rdquo; and insisted the campaign was slowing an increase in serious cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever wealthy countries say, a booster-shot campaign is going to set back global vaccination. And given the mutation pattern of Covid-19, these gaps in vaccination around the globe virtually guarantee the rise of new variants. While the mu variant is now established as a variant of interest, the C.1.2 variant is being closely monitored because it carries changes that have given some previous variants increased transmissibility. First detected in South Africa in May, it has also been detected in seven countries in Africa, Europe, Asia and Oceania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is understandable that Western countries might rush to inoculate their populations fully instead of making decisions about other nations. However, this strategy is broken. We might think of defeating Covid-19 in war terms, but in truth it is global cooperation that is vital for victory. Wealthier countries could use up all the Covid-19 vaccines in existence only to face a new variant that developed in an unvaccinated country. Thus, theoretically, those booster shots might have more impact if they were sent abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most effective way to combat the delta, mu and other variants is to expand manufacturing capacity to regions where vaccination rates are low. We must overcome the dismal vaccine rollout in emerging markets to see if we can get a handle on new variants. But this is easier said than done. Lost in the clouds of disinformation surrounding Covid are concerning statements about intellectual property law and the vaccine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April, Bill Gates stated his opposition to expanding the manufacturing of the vaccine to developing nations because it would complicate vaccine trials, and most countries didn&rsquo;t have the technical capacity to manufacture these specialized vaccines. Not only is that line of thinking wrong, but it reveals one of the most uncomfortable realities about the vaccines. Pharmaceutical companies are eyeing their bottom lines more than thinking about how we can collectively put a stop to Covid variants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider the recent news from South Africa. After the government struck a landmark deal with Johnson &amp; Johnson to finish manufacturing vaccine doses in the country, The New York Times discovered that many locally finished doses were being exported to the European Union. Over several months, the EU received as many as 32 million doses from the South Africa operation, even though countries across southern Africa desperately need vaccine supplies. Johnson &amp; Johnson was able to outsource a part of the manufacturing process to South Africa and then export the doses to Europe, which likely netted the company a handsome margin since costs are relatively low in South Africa, and European governments can pay a premium for the vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The situation in some regions is so bad that countries like Taiwan began using its own domestically developed vaccine this month instead of waiting on global vaccines that haven&rsquo;t materialized. The Taiwanese government ordered 16 million doses of the AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines early this year but has only received 4 million so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear. A sudden shift in vaccine policy where Western countries refocus efforts on a genuinely global vaccination drive isn&rsquo;t going to defeat the pandemic by itself. By most accounts, we will have to deal with this virus for some years to come. But pulling the curtain back on the uneven vaccine deployment and resolving the reasons for this sad state of affairs can help us handle the next variant, and pandemic. In this battle, cooperation is the most potent weapon we have.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638163797.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'booster-shots-wont-stop-the-next-covid-19-variant', '', '2021-11-29 10:59:57', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

But It Will Be Syria that Wins', NULL, NULL, '<p>While parties in Lebanon and the government of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/failed-economics-syria-restructures-its-subsidy-system/\">Syria</a>&nbsp;celebrated a plan for pumping Egyptian gas to Lebanon, depicting it as a victory against their imperial enemies, first and foremost America, the plan was in fact American, designed as a &ldquo;crisis management&rdquo; measure to help mitigate the effects of a free-falling Lebanon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Controlled by a militia whose endless regional wars have killed economic growth, Lebanon has run out of foreign currency, and therefore its imports of basic staples &mdash; including fuel &mdash; have dwindled to a crisis-inducing level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without fuel, electric-power cuts have become endemic. Lebanese households now receive about two hours of electricity a day, thus increasing their reliance on small, private power generators. But these too have to find &ldquo;fresh dollars&rdquo; to buy diesel, while their customers settle their bills in the ever-devaluating national currency. Both dollars and diesel have become scarce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electricity cuts and diesel scarcity now threaten the work of important sectors of the economy, including healthcare. The American University of Beirut, whose hospital has been operating without interruption since 1860, in August issued a dire statement begging for help. The hospital said that without either uninterrupted state electricity or diesel, it would have to shut down vital medical equipment, which would cause the death &mdash; within days &mdash; of around 100 patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was perhaps this plea that prompted the US embassy in Beirut to work on a plan involving importing gas from Egypt and electricity produced in Jordan with Egyptian gas, in order to avoid impending disaster. Ambassador Dorothy Shea called president Michel Aoun to tell him that her country had a plan, and Aoun boasted that the electricity crisis was soon coming to an end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While details are still scant, the plan&rsquo;s basic outline is to revive the &ldquo;Arab Pipeline&rdquo; that saw Egypt pump gas to Lebanon through Jordan between 2008 and 2010. According to former prime minister Fouad Siniora, Syria received the Egyptian gas in the south, and supplied Lebanon from its reserves in the north. Of the dozen power plants in Lebanon, only three of them are powered by gas. All are in the northern town of Deir Ammar and can produce a total of 435 megawatts of power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shea also said that Washington would facilitate payments to Cairo, on behalf of Beirut, using World Bank assistance funds budgeted for Lebanon. On average, producing one gas-powered megawatt of electricity costs $50 an hour. If Deir Ammar plants operated on a 24-hour basis, Lebanon&rsquo;s gas bill from Egypt will come up to roughly $200 million a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But 435 MW barely cover Lebanon&rsquo;s electricity needs. Peak demand is estimated at over 3,000 MW. Deir Ammar will therefore cover only 15 percent of Lebanon&rsquo;s needs, or the equivalent of three-and-a-half hours of electric supply a day, hardly a victory for the country&rsquo;s ruler, Hezbollah, or its protege, Aoun. But then, better than that tanker full of Iranian fuel supposedly headed ultimately for Lebanese power plants &mdash; and how long would that oil last? &mdash; so a double whammy against Hezbollah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the plan pans out, Lebanon will produce electricity for the needs of vital sectors, such as hospitals. Second in line will be public facilities, like the airport. Lastly, households might get an extra hour or two of power to the two they now receive. The Lebanese will keep suffering because of electricity cuts, but the US embassy would have at least avoided the shutdown of hospitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American plan for Lebanon&rsquo;s electricity still faces several hurdles. To start with, the gas has to go through Syria, which gives the Syrian government a say in the whole process. Plans for Jordanian-produced electricity seems now to have been dialed down. But that electricity would also have had to transit through Syria. The reason it is now only a &ldquo;future&rdquo; possibility, as the Lebanese energy minister put it, is because the grid in Syria needs repair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Syria, however, is under US sanctions imposed on the Bashar Al-Assad regime. This means that the US plan requires the White House to file a waiver with Congress to suspend parts of the sanctions-imposing Caesar Act. In his recent visit to Beirut, Senator Chris Van Hollen said he and a number of his colleagues were working on ways to allow the Egyptian gas to pass through Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Syrian officials have so far expressed their willingness to facilitate the US plan, even if Damascus does not get a cut. The plan, after all, gives Al-Assad the regional and global recognition he has been desperate for. Once the pipes start pumping, the world will have a vested interest in keeping Al-Assad in place. Over the past half century, the regime has perfected the art of &ldquo;being useful&rdquo; to global powers, expecting favors in return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For helping Lebanon with its electricity crisis, Washington will have to grant Al-Assad some recognition and attention, a price the Biden administration seems willing to pay. The American plan will only marginally improve Lebanon&rsquo;s electricity situation. How much it benefits Al-Assad is immeasurable.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638163859.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'if-plans-work-lebanon-will-get-gas-from-egypt-for-electricity-but-it-will-be-syria-that-wins', '', '2021-11-29 11:00:59', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(157, 4, 10, 'Turkey’s Environmental Failure', NULL, NULL, '<p>Turkey has had, literally, a test by fire this summer. Along the southern coast of Anatolia, over 270 forest fires tore through 53 provinces. Nine people died. The ferociousness of this year&rsquo;s conflagration &ndash; the worst ever &ndash; came down to one thing: ineptitude. Ineptitude in understanding the scale of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/turkey-forest-fire-conspiracy/\">climate change</a>, and in response to environmental calamity. The fires are symptomatic of Turkey&rsquo;s environmental failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wildfires are endemic to the region; they are expected every year, and have been for thousands of years. In 2019, 11 square kilometers were lost to wildfires. This escalated to 20 square kilometers last year. But a 30 percent increase in aridity and record-breaking temperatures this year have intensified the damage. A record 1,600 square kilometers of forest were lost to fire, showing something altogether different was happening this year. Such is the accelerating pace of climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, such effects can be mitigated. For example, by better tree planting under the country&rsquo;s very own reforestation program. But such a decision would have to go through Turkey&rsquo;s forestry department, the agency in charge of stewardship of the country&rsquo;s land bank. And that&rsquo;s where the problem begins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The department allocated 193 million Turkish lira in its budget this year for firefighting. That&rsquo;s roughly $22 million in today&rsquo;s (much depressed) exchange rate. However, it spent only 3.4 million lira on fire mitigation projects and equipment in the first half of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when fire descended on the town of Manavgat in Antalya province, Turkey was able to deploy only two firefighting aircraft. The country has a total of three such working planes. Other aircraft owned by the Turkish Aeronautical Association were deemed &ldquo;old and not usable&rdquo; and were not permitted to join the fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government seemed to think it could banish the fires by an exertion of will. On August 2, the radio and television regulator warned TV stations not to give as much coverage to ongoing fires as they did to the successes in extinguishing forest burns. It threatened penalties for those that failed to do so. The following week, six stations, including HaberTurk and Fox News, were fined. Media outlets sympathetic to the government&rsquo;s position, however, duly focused on areas where firefighting was more successful. This led many celebrities, such as the comedian and actor Sahan Gokbahar, to travel to areas with ongoing fires and report on them through social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the face of a lack of government action, ordinary Turks took it upon themselves to organize a global call for help. The hashtag HelpTurkey went viral. The government, however, saw this as an attempt to undermine the administration. One official said it made Turkey look &ldquo;weak,&rdquo; and began a counter campaign with the hashtags WeDontNeedHelp and StrongTurkey. An investigation was launched into social media accounts that shared the hashtag HelpTurkey, accusing the owners of spreading &ldquo;anxiety and fear.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If all of this weren&rsquo;t so tragic, it would have been laughable. What is one, after all, to make of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, tossing bags of tea to disaster victims from a moving vehicle?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speculations currently are circulating that the fires were started by arsonists. The mayor of Antalya, who is also the head of the province of the same name, recently voiced such suspicions. So has the presidential communications director, Fahrettin Altun (the same one who said pleas for international help made Turkey look weak), who swore that investigations would be launched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if precedents are anything to go by, they won&rsquo;t amount to much. Although Turkey, in fact, offers protection to its forests in its constitution, noting that &ldquo;forested areas that burn down can under no circumstances be zoned for construction and must therefore be reforested,&rdquo; in too many cases the scorched land is replaced with real estate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simple fact is that larger and more frequent forest fires must be expected. Turkey&rsquo;s government has never been known to be populated by &ldquo;tree huggers&rdquo; and that isn&rsquo;t about to change. But while it is bad enough to do nothing &ndash; Turkey is one of six countries, and the only one of the G20, yet to ratify the Paris agreement on climate change &ndash; it is another thing to be aiding the rapid march of disaster. Thousands of hectares of forests have been cut down to make way for mining, airports and other projects. In mid-August, several residents in the city of Mugla were arrested for trying to save trees that were being felled by a mining company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if fires weren&rsquo;t bad enough, the Sea of Marmara has been plagued this summer by &ldquo;sea snot.&rdquo; Sea snot is as disgusting as it sounds: the actual mucus secretion of an overabundance of phytoplankton that feed on uncontrolled fertilizer run-offs. On land and in the sea, the government&rsquo;s mismanagement of the environment, its stewardship of nature, will have repercussions for many generations to come.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638163958.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'turkeys-environmental-failure', '', '2021-11-29 11:02:38', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

As skirmishes along the Armenian-Azerbaijan border increased in recent weeks, there was even speculation that Turkey was on the brink of forging a joint military force with Baku. Turkey helped Azerbaijan come out on top of the six-week conflict over the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/iran-and-the-caucasus-tehran-powerless-in-its-former-domain/\">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>&nbsp;region and it wants to capitalize by further boosting its influence in the South Caucasus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under president Recep Tayyip Erdogan&rsquo;s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Turkey has made no secret of its thirst for a grander role in swaths of the Arab Middle East, Libya and the Eastern Mediterranean. But if it pushes too far in the Caucasus, it risks antagonizing Russia, which views the region as its own historical backyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Symbolized by the popular motto of &ldquo;one nation, two states,&rdquo; Turkey and Azerbaijan have held a close bond since Baku declared independence in 1991. The countries are predominantly Muslim, share ethnic and cultural similarities and are linked by strong economic interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chronic, shared concern between the two is thwarting the regional ambitions of Armenia. Turkey and Armenia have no diplomatic relations and a history of hostility that dates back a century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ties between Ankara and Baku grew deeper after Turkey threw its support behind Azerbaijan during last year&rsquo;s conflict. Ankara supplied Azeri forces with armed Bayraktar TB2 drones that were used to devastating effect against Armenian troops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The war ended with a Russia-brokered deal in November and resulted in Baku&rsquo;s military victory over several cities and nearly 300 settlements and villages. At least 5,000 soldiers and more than 140 civilians were killed in the fighting, which also displaced tens of thousands of people. The outcome delivered a blow to Armenia&rsquo;s claims to the region that span nearly three decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In signs that tensions are far from over, there have been pockets of fighting along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border over the past few weeks. On Aug. 1, the Azeri defense ministry said Armenian army elements targeted its positions and Baku responded with retaliatory fire. In early August, at least three Armenian troops died and two Azeri soldiers were wounded in clashes in Azerbaijan&rsquo;s Kalbajar district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this may have fueled reports in the Turkish media that a joint Azerbaijan-Turkey force was imminent. The speculation was later rowed back, after it turned out the source of the confusion was a poor translation of a statement by Turkish parliament speaker Mustafa Sentop at the signing ceremony of the Baku Declaration on July 28 between Turkey, Azerbaijan and Pakistan. But the prospect of a joint army had seemed plausible given that military cooperation between Ankara and Baku has steadily grown since the conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ankara is adamant that it cannot lose influence over the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement and is looking to enhance its caretaker role in the South Caucasus. In late June, the Turkish and Azeri militaries conducted joint drills in Baku that involved military personnel, tanks and drones. Similar bilateral exercises were held last year, made possible by a 2010 agreement that mandates cooperation when either country faces aggression from a third state or group of states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkey and Azerbaijan signed the Shusha Declaration in July, named after the city in the Nagorno-Karabakh region that Azerbaijan now controls, affirming a joint commitment to defense cooperation, stability and prosperity in the region. A central concern lies with restructuring and modernizing their armed forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rumors that Turkey may be planning a military base in Azerbaijan is cause for concern for Russia, which has its own base in Armenia. Moscow has deployed 2,000 peacekeepers to the region and wants to maintain a monopoly over the balance of power there. On July 20, president Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan met with Vladimir Putin in Moscow for the second time this year to discuss the post-war peace agreement and a way forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia is not the only one with an interest in how the Azerbaijan-Armenia ceasefire deal plays out. Brussels seeks the revival of the Minsk Group under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), paving the way for the US and France (as Minsk co-chairs) to take on a larger mediating role. From their perspective, the conflict has not been resolved once and for all. European council president Charles Michel said in July during a visit to Yerevan that &ldquo;the status of Nagorno-Karabakh must also be addressed.&rdquo; For years, Azerbaijan expressed frustration with the stalled Minsk process and is not keen to assign it any significant role in the border demarcation process with Armenia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, Turkish foreign policy has prioritized the creation of a medley of regional organizations, pacts and local summits as potential counterweights to established Western multilateral organizations and powerhouses like Russia and Iran. For example, the recent trilateral agreement with Pakistan and Azerbaijan or reports earlier this year of reviving Turkey-Israel relations through Azeri mediation. Turkey recently hinted at a new six-state platform to support peace in the Caucasus that would include Turkey, Azerbaijan, Russia, Iran, Georgia and Armenia. Turkey is keen to sign off on a success story in its otherwise rancorous foreign policymaking, and amid its domestic economic woes and plummeting currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But against the backdrop of a burgeoning bilateral military pact between Ankara and Baku, Russia and neighboring states are hesitant to buy in to its rhetoric on regional cooperation. Peripheral states have always managed their relationship with Russia carefully, wary of the consequences of a misstep. While Turkey tries to tinker with the regional balance of power, it is unclear just how much it can achieve beyond its safe-bet alliance with Azerbaijan.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638164041.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'azerbaijan-support-underpins-turkeys-ambitions-in-the-south-caucasus', '', '2021-11-29 11:04:01', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

But it is possible that the statue of Abdul Ali Mazari, a champion of Afghanistan&rsquo;s ethnic Hazara minority who was executed by the Taliban in 1995, ticked more than one box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Mazari&rsquo;s statue had no great cultural or artistic value. Its destruction has made it more famous than it would ever have been otherwise. But more interestingly, it stood in Bamiyan province. For it was in Bamiyan, in 2001, that the Taliban blew up two massive, 1,500-year-old statues of Buddha carved into a mountainside. The dynamiting of the statues remains possibly the biggest act of wanton destruction of culture in modern history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, then, is the Mazari statue&rsquo;s destruction a sign of things to come? With the fight against the &ldquo;others&rdquo; &mdash; the foreign forces that occupied Afghanistan &mdash; now over, will the fight now turn inward against the &ldquo;others&rdquo; in Afghanistan&rsquo;s historic, religious and social tableau?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those &ldquo;others&rdquo; are plentiful in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afghanistan has a wealthy heritage and history, and a diversity of identities that have been overshadowed by wars and conflicts. It was from Afghanistan that Buddhism spread to China. Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism thrived in the land before &mdash; and after &mdash; the arrival of Islam in the 7th century. As a major waystation on the thousands-of-years-old trade routes connecting India with Iran and China, Afghanistan is filled with the remains of ancient cities, monasteries and caravanserais that hosted famous travelers like the 14th century Moroccan, Ibn Battuta, and the 13th century Venetian, Marco Polo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ancient artifacts literally are strewn across its geography. Some 80,000 of these now are housed in the National Museum. The Taliban destroyed a number of such artifacts in the museum the first time they came to power. But in February this year, its leaders forbade selling artifacts. They told their followers to &ldquo;robustly protect, monitor and preserve&rdquo; relics, halt illegal digs and safeguard &ldquo;all historic sites.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We shall have to see if that injunction holds. Will the Taliban, for example, protect the historical heart of the city of Herat? It is currently on a Unesco heritage site tentative list. Herat was captured by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE during his campaign against the Achaemenids. It later became a major outpost for the Hellenistic Seleucid empire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, there is Balkh, which gave birth not only to Rumi, but also Ibn Sina &mdash; better known in the West as Avicenna &mdash; and the poet Ferdowsi, both from around the turn of the first millennium. The name Balkh may be more familiar to those who frequent Western museums as Bactria, the ancient civilization that dates back to the early third millennium BCE. From the Seleucids to the Sassanians to many others, the history of civilization is layered in the ground of Balkh and many other cities like it across Afghanistan &mdash; sites like Mes Aynak, home to a complex of at least seven Buddhist monasteries and under which may be Bronze Age structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is tempting to think that the Taliban have changed &mdash; after all, the rest of the world certainly has. We want to believe that they will police adherence to their injunction to do no harm to the country&rsquo;s historical and cultural heritage. The problem is, the Taliban are committed to keeping themselves pure from the poison of modernity. The future has not caught up with them and likely never will. And aside from their own version of an imagined past, the rest is dust to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there may be a way out. The Taliban frown on drug use. But they don&rsquo;t have a moral problem with other people using it. In 2000, they banned poppy cultivation, much like they have banned trading in historical artifacts today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That poppy ban, however, eventually evaporated. Today, the Taliban control the world&rsquo;s largest supply of illegal opiates &mdash; accounting for 80 percent of the global opium and heroin market. A record harvest in 2017 yielded sales the equivalent of 7 percent of Afghanistan&rsquo;s GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The intriguing question then is whether the Taliban can be induced to protect the heritage of Afghanistan if they were paid to do so. They may have no use and see no value in a sculpture of a Bactrian woman, for example. But can they be persuaded to keep it safe if it was a source of income? Can an international trust fund be established for this? And maybe for the safekeeping of artifacts outside Afghanistan? (Though, until when?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many questions. Including the moral one of privileging the safety of cultural items over the safety and wellbeing of people. Yet, surely it&rsquo;s still one that would be useful to have. But the first question is, will the Taliban take part?</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638164125.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'fall-of-kabul-how-to-get-the-taliban-to-protect-afghanistans-culture', '', '2021-11-29 11:05:25', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(160, 4, 10, 'Fall of Kabul: Why Afghanistan’s Security Forces Collapsed So Quickly to the Taliban', NULL, NULL, '<p>AFP photo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the dust settles on the collapse of the government in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/taliban-takeover-victory-afghanistan-iran/\">Kabul</a>, the blame game has begun. There are many and varied reasons for this calamitous end to the US project in Afghanistan, from the April decision of the current US president, to strategic blunders of several of Biden&rsquo;s predecessors. And while some are offended at the notion that Afghans themselves might need to take partial responsibility for the collapse of the government and the return of the Taliban to power, it is not unreasonable to consider why the Afghan security forces were not able to muster more strength and will to confront the Taliban, and to defend the capital, Kabul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the two-decade long engagement in Afghanistan, creating an effective national security system was the core function of US and Nato policy, alongside improved governance by civilian leaders. It had been widely accepted that the only way to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorism again, as it was in 2001, was to create a modern security sector, with police to protect civilians and defend the rule of law, and a national military force to protect the borders and prevent local or outside threats to the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the total $2 trillion price tag of America&rsquo;s longest war, about 10 percent ($183 billion according to one US government report) was allocated to the training and equipping of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). That investment was key to the rationale for the US withdrawal from the country. Particularly after the US declared its combat operations completed in 2014, US policy hinged on demonstrating that the Afghans had the capacity to defend their country and provide security for their citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US and Nato worked to support a national army of as many as 300,000 soldiers, a border police force, a prison system based on international standards and a special operations force for counter-terrorism operations. Of these various institutions, the special operations forces, at 20,000-30,000 strong, was considered the most successful. US officials concede that training a modern police force largely failed, and many questioned whether the US set too high a bar for the national army, envisioning a large well-equipped force that would be a source of national pride and cohesion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet president Biden&rsquo;s commitment to ending the forever war has appeared to be washing the US&rsquo;s hands of that project. He and his advisors insisted during the days before the fall of Kabul that the country&rsquo;s civilian and military leaders needed to take charge; the US had completed its task of providing the means for a credible national defense. Biden showed impatience, if not disdain, for the poor performance of the Afghan forces in the face of the Taliban surge from the countryside to provincial capitals and then Kabul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collapse of the forces will be studied in the years ahead, but among the factors to be considered, here are five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First is the political context, dating from the very beginning of the post-9/11 invasion. Because the US relied on the Northern Alliance to oust the Taliban from power in 2001, the old warlord system of regional militia and power centers was never dismantled. This is significant because it undermined the basic political objective of creating a more democratic system, and made it harder to create a new security culture in which the Western-trained national security forces would really enjoy a monopoly of power and prestige.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second is the reality of the human capital available to create a modern security sector. There are many capable and courageous career military officers in the country, to be sure, but recruiting suitable young men and women to the rank-and-file of the police and army was a daunting task. At the pivotal turning point in 2014, US experts estimated that half of the recruits to the armed forces were illiterate. The US had to launch a program to teach reading and writing to the troops before it could address other essential skills for the defense of the country. The goals of the remedial program were to have soldiers who could count, write their names and use a basic vocabulary at the third-grade level. Before the international force instituted an automated payment system, soldiers would routinely leave their posts after pay day and walk to their villages to provide their meager pay to their families, often disappearing for long periods before returning to their official duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third are the shortcomings of the political system that evolved through contested elections and failures to confront corruption and mismanagement. Former president Ashraf Ghani, who fled the country on August 15, failed to inspire Afghans. They saw the perpetuation of the old system, with a leader and Kabul elites who embraced the World Bank and development theories, but who were not able to change the socio-economic fundamentals of this very poor country. It&rsquo;s an old Afghan problem &ndash; governing from the capital has always been hard &ndash; but in a more connected age, Afghans in rural areas know more about what goes on in Kabul, and that has fostered deep resentment, creating opportunities for the Taliban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A related fourth factor is captured in Biden&rsquo;s exasperation with the Ghani administration and its military leaders &ndash; where is the political will to fight? The US had provided capacity in terms of equipment and training, but capabilities are only part of the equation. The former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, told CNN, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t buy political will.&rdquo; The fatalism of the government in Kabul, and the failure of civilian leaders to rally the country against the dangers of a resurgent Taliban, will need to be studied. Rather than focus only on the collapse of the armed forces, it will be critical to examine how the civilian leadership failed to mobilize the forces in an effective way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And last but not least is the hubris of the outside players who believed their own rhetoric about the desire and the ability of the Afghans to emulate the models of a national, integrated military force that would be apolitical and loyal to the nation. To be fair, one can find plenty of Pentagon reports with sharp analysis about the shortcomings of US efforts in Afghanistan. But there is a tendency to create metrics of progress that in hindsight are often mindless, and miss the dynamics in play for young apolitical Afghans who will join the ANDSF, or the Taliban, if they think it&rsquo;s the best way to survive.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638164255.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'fall-of-kabul-why-afghanistans-security-forces-collapsed-so-quickly-to-the-taliban', '', '2021-11-29 11:07:35', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

It was as if the president was looking down, tapping his watch, saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this done before September 11, and move on to the next issue.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A former US ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, writing in The New York Times, condemned Biden for his lack of &ldquo;strategic patience.&rdquo; Crocker recounted the significant &ndash; if flawed and halting &ndash; progress made in Afghanistan over the last two decades &ndash; now unraveling before our eyes. &ldquo;When president Barack Obama left office there were fewer than 10,000 US troops,&rdquo; Crocker wrote. &ldquo;And when Mr Trump departed there were fewer than 5,000. The Taliban still did not hold any major urban area. Now, they hold the entire country. What changed so swiftly and completely? We did. Mr Biden&rsquo;s decision to withdraw all US forces destroyed an affordable status quo that could have lasted indefinitely at a minimum cost in blood and treasure.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An &ldquo;affordable status quo&rdquo; was a good way to put it. Afghanistan still had a long nation-building effort ahead of it, and most of it was being done by Afghans, under an affordable US security umbrella. Yes, there were problems and mismanagement and corruption, but let&rsquo;s not forget that it took America nearly two centuries and a civil war to fulfill some of the basic promises of its constitution &ndash; and let us also not forget the hell the Taliban created for Afghans when they ruled from 1996-2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henry Kissinger once told a top aide that foreign policy issues are not problems that can be &ldquo;solved.&rdquo; Rather, they are issues that must be &ldquo;managed.&rdquo; Trump wanted to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; Afghanistan by negotiating with the Taliban and declaring a timeline for troop withdrawal &ndash; a bad idea. Biden jumped on this bad idea bandwagon, steering it way off course, crashing into the gutter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Biden is the primary author of this failure of &ldquo;strategic patience,&rdquo; Trump and Obama laid the roots for it. This partly goes back to Obama&rsquo;s pledge to &ldquo;rebalance&rdquo; US policy toward the Asia-Pacific and away from the &ldquo;forever wars&rdquo; of the post-9/11 era &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;pivot to Asia.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a worldview that has percolated to the top of the U.S national security establishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama and Trump did not agree on much and their styles contrasted sharply, but they both instinctively wanted to &ldquo;get out&rdquo; of the Middle East conflict management arena, so they could focus more attention on the rising power in East Asia, China. Never mind the fact that the US still had tens of thousands of troops in South Korea and Germany &ndash; a conflict management exercise arising from World War II and the Korean War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview published in The Atlantic magazine, Obama famously called several of America&rsquo;s top Middle East allies &ldquo;free riders&rdquo; on the American security umbrella, dragging the US into regional and sectarian conflicts. He said that the US should focus on the fast-growing markets of Asia and Latin America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a realpolitik &ldquo;America First&rdquo; impulse in Obama&rsquo;s worldview that often goes unmentioned because it was also that that brought to power Trump &ndash; the declared &ldquo;America First&rdquo; president. Obama displayed this callous, realpolitik when he failed to enforce his own &ldquo;red line&rdquo; when Syria&rsquo;s Bashar Al-Assad used chemical weapons on his own people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama declared that core American interests were not at stake. While Obama still elicits swoons and cheers from his admirers, for the vast majority of Syrians, he left them alone to face barrel bombs and devastation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, for his part, was eager to remove all US special forces from Syria, though the generals tamped down his enthusiasm, while national security advisors diverted his attention. While Trump chose Saudi Arabia as his first foreign visit, his relations with regional powers tended to be transactional rather than strategic and, always, there was the idea of &ldquo;getting the hell out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the national security establishment in Washington had long moved away from one popular acronym, GWOT (the Global War on Terror), toward a new one, GPC, or Great Power Competition. Strategic policy making, it should be noted, should never be beholden to acronyms nor simple timelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joe Biden, it seems, also has a callous &ldquo;America First&rdquo; streak. As the author George Packer reports in an insightful biography of Richard Holbrooke, then vice-president Biden reacted sharply when he was asked if the US had a humanitarian obligation to the people of Afghanistan. &ldquo;F*** that,&rdquo; Biden reportedly told Holbrooke in 2010. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. We did it in Vietnam. Nixon and Kissinger got away with it,&rdquo; he is reported to have said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is striking for a president who has declared that human rights and democracy will return to the US foreign-policy agenda. In Afghanistan, you had a modest US troop presence that was keeping the country out of the hands of the Taliban &ndash; a notorious human-rights-abusing group. You also had a flawed, fledgling democracy with working institutions of state, and plenty of people trying to do the right thing (even amid the corruption at the top).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To borrow from Kissinger, this seemed like an issue that could be managed, rather than &ldquo;solved&rdquo; with a questionable troop withdrawal on a tight timeline against the advice of your generals. By doing so, Biden has assured that Afghanistan will not be the distant, back-page foreign-policy issue it had become. It will now be front and center for the next four years.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638164344.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'fall-of-kabul-like-trump-biden-has-an-america-first-streak-it-led-to-the-disaster-in-afghanistan', '', '2021-11-29 11:09:04', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

In fact, Modi&rsquo;s speech was particularly remarkable for its relative lack of references to foreign policy. Indeed, more can be made out by what he left out rather than what he included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of naming Pakistan or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/china-israel-palestine-diplomacy/\">China</a>, Modi referred to terrorism and expansionism as the twin challenges his government has faced over the last year. Last summer, the Indian and Chinese armies clashed along their disputed border along the Himalayas. Despite a limited ceasefire, China still controls territory claimed by India. The picture is murkier yet as Modi&rsquo;s government has been remarkably reticent about the specifics of the ceasefire. The prime minister even went so far as to tell parliament last year that China did not intrude into territory claimed by India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is likely that India is still hedging when it comes to China. Despite being part of the Quad, a group comprising Australia, Japan, India and the US, New Delhi has been unable to extract the benefits of being part of an overt front against China. This explains Modi&rsquo;s reluctance to mention China by name, let alone celebrate the increased security ties with the US. Overall, it betrays strategic incoherence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ties with Pakistan remain in deep freeze, particularly after India removed Kashmir&rsquo;s autonomy in 2019 and imposed direct federal control on the territory. India-Pakistan ties are likely to be complicated further with the Taliban coming to power this week in Afghanistan. A Taliban-controlled Afghanistan gives Pakistan&rsquo;s military the strategic depth against India that Islamabad has long craved. Moreover, this may lead to an uptick in terrorism in South Asia, specifically directed at Indian control of Kashmir. Yet other than harking back to when India is believed to have carried out &ldquo;surgical strikes&rdquo; on purported terrorist camps in Pakistan territory in 2019, Modi said very little about Pakistan &ndash; India&rsquo;s most critical foreign-policy issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Kashmir, Modi completely ignored the fact that the mood in the territory remains febrile. Modi did however mention the recently conducted local polls. But he failed to mention a dismally low voter turnout and that his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, was roundly trounced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it is significant that he mentioned a &ldquo;delimitation commission,&rdquo; a body tasked with redrawing electoral districts in the region. Kashmiris are wary of regulations introduced by Delhi that make it easier for non-local people to claim domicile rights and buy land in the region. They allege this is part of India&rsquo;s plan to change the region&rsquo;s demography, much like China has done with Xinjiang, where years of Han Chinese migration has reduced the Uyghurs to a minority in several cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kashmiris suspect that a Delhi-appointed delimitation commission will privilege territory over people and skew the territory&rsquo;s elected assembly toward heftier representation from the region&rsquo;s Hindu-majority areas, thus reducing political representation for Muslims. That Modi chose to mention the delimitation commission explicitly in his speech suggests he is willing to tolerate the foreign-policy costs of continued volatility in Kashmir so long as he gets to use it as a totemic issue with which to consolidate support from his Hindu-nationalist base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even as things were heating up in Kabul the very day of his speech, Modi said nothing about Afghanistan, one of the biggest disasters for India&rsquo;s foreign policy in recent times. Because successive governments have been unable to look beyond the Taliban&rsquo;s ties to Pakistan, New Delhi today, unlike Tehran or Moscow, has zero leverage with the militant group. The Taliban&rsquo;s control of Afghanistan seriously imperil India&rsquo;s decades-long investments in Afghanistan&rsquo;s social and political sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Myanmar, too, Modi said little other than to mention the country as part of Delhi&rsquo;s Act East policy, which aims to increase linkages with Southeast Asian countries. Yet, even on Myanmar, New Delhi has been unable to develop a coherent approach toward the military junta now ruling the country, watching helplessly as Myanmar further drifts toward China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his speech, Modi told Indians they were entering an &ldquo;Amrit Kaal,&rdquo; or a period of immortality (in Hindu mythology, Amrit refers to an immortality-conferring ambrosia while Kaal is the word for a cyclical period of time). This seems particularly cruel, given that up to 5 million Indians may have lost their lives due to Covid-19 over the last year, 10 times the Indian government&rsquo;s official death toll. On the issue of foreign policy though, Modi spared Indians such tone-deafness.

As events currently unfolding in Afghanistan show, however, when it comes to many of the thousands of Afghan interpreters who over the past 20 years have risked their lives helping allied forces, that promise is an entirely hollow one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hasty withdrawal of allied troops from Afghanistan and the predictable resurgence of the Taliban is proving, equally predictably, to be a death sentence for anyone who aided &ldquo;the enemy&rdquo; during the long years since the ousting of the Taliban in 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sohail Pardis worked with the Americans as a translator for almost 18 months before his employment was terminated in 2012 after he failed a polygraph test. The polygraph, a notoriously unreliable &ldquo;lie detector&rdquo; test, was used regularly to clear Afghans for entry to allied bases. More recently it has been part of the approval process for former Afghan employees of the American and other foreign forces seeking visas to start a new life overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failing the test cost Pardis his chance of a new life in America and, ultimately, cost the 32-year-old his life. In May, long after the Americans he had aided had returned to the safety of their own country, Pardis was stopped at a roadblock by the Taliban and beheaded by the side of the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His is not an isolated fate. Sources suggest thousands like him have already been murdered by the Taliban. And, as allied governments dither and refuse visas on petty bureaucratic grounds, thousands more are likely to die as the Taliban extends its hold over Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June, the Taliban promised not to harm Afghans who had worked for foreign forces. None who have received death threats believes the promise, including one linguist who told CNN recently that he had worked for five years alongside US special forces but had had his visa application rejected. It didn&rsquo;t matter that the commanders of the SEAL teams he had helped vouched for his good service in written testimonies, reporting that he had repeatedly &ldquo;braved enemy fire and undoubtedly saved the lives of Americans and Afghans alike.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His own life now hangs in the balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One former translator for UK special forces who, like so many, is still awaiting news of his long-delayed visa application, told the British Telegraph newspaper that &ldquo;thousands of interpreters have been killed.

I think British people are fair but the British government is different. They are not treating us fairly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is clear that if it were left to the soldiers who relied so heavily on them, not one of the interpreters would be left behind. Several former UK military chiefs, for example, have written to their government urging it to rethink its policy, and last week on BBC Radio there was a telling interview with a British army officer who spoke movingly of his efforts to find out what had happened to the men he had served with in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One had already been killed, he discovered. Another, &ldquo;Sharif,&rdquo; has had his visa application rejected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We did our six-month tour, but Sharif stayed on with British units for a total of three years,&rdquo; the ex-soldier said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharif&rsquo;s application was refused because in 2009 he had been dismissed for unspecified &ldquo;disciplinary reasons.&rdquo; Furthermore, the former captain found out, &ldquo;about a third of our interpreters were dismissed for this vague reason. There is a need to renew these cases.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>British and American veterans of the long and ultimately futile war in Afghanistan, he added, &ldquo;have a strong sense of duty, a tie to these people&hellip; It&rsquo;s really important for us as we struggle with what we&rsquo;re now seeing in the news that we at the very least don&rsquo;t abandon our interpreters. The bonds that we had with our interpreters were particularly close. They were our mouthpieces as we went into those Afghan communities, and we gave people our assurances of democracy, stability and progress.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is, of course, no fault of the soldiers who gave those assurances that their governments were, in the end, unable to make good on them. But it isn&rsquo;t, of course, the first time that, in the interests of political or military expediency, that Western powers intervening in the region have made promises they either could not, or never intended, to keep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Arab revolt against the Ottomans that arose in the Hijaz during the First World War was incited by the British government, with TE Lawrence &ldquo;of Arabia&rdquo; as its convincing front man, on the false promise of a pan-Arabian state for Arabs after the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iconic photograph of Americans fleeing by helicopter from the roof of the US embassy in Saigon in April 1970, while the abandoned South Vietnamese citizens clamored hopelessly at the gates, tells its own vivid story of betrayal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, in 1991 America was content to encourage the Kurds of northern Iraq to rise against Saddam Hussein, leaving them to their fate after they heeded the call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afghanistan, in other words, is just the latest in a long series of betrayals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the outset, there was never the slightest chance that well-meaning foreign soldiers, tourists in Afghanistan&rsquo;s complex political and cultural landscape, would ever be able to deliver on the promises of democracy, stability and progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American and British soldiers who made those promises are safe, back home in their own world.

Yet climate change has only exacerbated an entirely man-made crisis brought on by years of rampant dam building, corruption, mismanagement and diversion of rivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Khuzestan is home to 80 percent of Iran&rsquo;s oil and 60 percent of its gas deposits. The extraction of these resources has caused pollution. Yet ethnic Arabs have also warned of a conspiracy by the Persian-dominated government in Tehran of deliberately trying to drive off Arabs from fertile lands to open up more areas for oil and gas extraction. Successive governments in Tehran have also built ill-conceived dams and diverted once-plentiful freshwater from Khuzestan&rsquo;s rivers to neighboring provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sensible thing for Tehran to do is to come up with a water-management policy and stop dam construction. Yet this will have profound implications for the country&rsquo;s political economy. For many years, dam-building has been the exclusive preserve of companies linked to the country&rsquo;s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which has used lucrative state contracts as a source of pilfering and patronage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran also subsidizes electricity and water for its population, which encourages wastage. Reducing these subsidies could further inflame tensions within the country. Instead, Tehran has reacted to its water crisis by shutting off water supplies to neighboring Iraq from the countries&rsquo; shared rivers. This has led to a water shortage in Iraq&rsquo;s Sunni-majority Diyala province. This could inflame sectarian tensions in Iraq and provide fresh recruits to the still-active ISIS. A revived ISIS and sectarian conflict is the last thing Iraq needs, just as its approaches a semblance of political stability with general elections scheduled for October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, in the absence of a regional grand strategy for sharing rivers and managing dam construction, water is likely to become a zero-sum game. In some instances, one region&rsquo;s development needs will mean less water for another. If Syria&rsquo;s agricultural heartland in its northeast is reinvigorated, the country will need to extract more water from the Euphrates. This means less water for Iraq.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other instances, countries will pursue a strategy of weaponizing water supplies to teach their perceived enemies a lesson. Indeed, Kurds in Syria&rsquo;s Al-Hasakah province have accused Turkey and its proxies of deliberately cutting off water supplies to their region. Istanbul views the province&rsquo;s governing Kurdish party as being closely allied to the Kurdistan Workers&rsquo; Party, which Istanbul considers a terrorist outfit. Similarly, Turkey has shied away from concluding an agreement with Iraq over their shared rivers, stating that it exercises absolute sovereignty of rivers that flow through its territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>States are also petrified of ending water subsidies to farmers in rural regions, lest they migrate toward the cities. Indeed, the precursor to the Syrian civil war, exacerbated no doubt by the Assad regime&rsquo;s brutality, was the drought that occurred in rural areas between 2006 and 2009. This led to the migration of as many as 1.5 million people to Syria&rsquo;s cities, inflaming social tensions in the country and eventually leading to civil war in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The political economy of several other countries in the region is fairly similar. Countries like Jordan provide subsidized water to powerful tribes in the Jordan valley that are the bedrock of political support for the regime in Amman. Similarly, Egypt is wary of the potentially catastrophic consequences for its domestic political stability should water flow from the Nile be reduced on account of Ethiopia&rsquo;s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam project. This has prompted Egypt&rsquo;s president, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, to warn that &ldquo;all options are possible&rdquo; should Ethiopia and Egypt fail to agree on the dam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that conflict over water barely features in Western analyses of the region&rsquo;s geopolitical predicaments points to Western political elites&rsquo; myopic view of the Middle East. The region&rsquo;s many conflicts are only looked at through the prism of religion and energy. These are of immense interest to the West, primarily due to the former&rsquo;s links to global terrorism and the latter to the West&rsquo;s energy security. Yet water scarcity and the resulting conflicts could produce a wave of refugees emerging from the region. This will lead to human suffering on an unimaginable scale, potentially leading to regional war, state collapse and destabilizing regions further afield, such as Europe and South Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is water, not oil or sectarian politics, that should occupy the minds of policymakers both in the Middle East and across the world.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638164556.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'water-scarcity-is-the-biggest-threat-to-stability-in-the-middle-east', '', '2021-11-29 11:12:36', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(165, 4, 12, 'Tunisians Want More from Democracy than Just to Vote. Can Saied Deliver?', NULL, NULL, '<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/tunisia-is-in-crisis/\">West</a>&nbsp;is struggling to understand Tunisia after president Kais Saied&rsquo;s suspension of parliament and dismissal of the prime minister. But it may be asking the wrong questions and not seeing the whole picture. It has failed to appreciate the monumental changes required &mdash; and with which the country has struggled &mdash; since the 2011 uprising that toppled long-time ruler Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. As in too many cases, the West failed to appreciate that its formalistic understanding of democracy &mdash; voting &mdash; does not always go hand-in-hand with the implicit, crucial necessity for the political process to be matched by sound governance and socioeconomic progress. For sake of Tunisia&rsquo;s people, the West should take the time to understand the country&rsquo;s complexities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it won&rsquo;t be easy. Witness a New York Times reporter&rsquo;s summing up of her impressions on the streets of Tunis: &ldquo;There was almost no sense of dread about the fate of Tunisian democracy; I went around feeling its lack like a phantom limb.&rdquo; For many in the West, Tunisia was the poster boy of the Arab Spring, a sort of ideal built on the pedestal of voting. Too simplistic and too detached from reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone who has paid attention to public opinion in Tunisia would have understood that the reality did not always match the West&rsquo;s political construct or expectations. Most Tunisians rejoiced at their hard-earned freedoms, but they never felt themselves custodians of the Arab Spring. While the outside world celebrated the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Tunisia&rsquo;s National Dialogue Quartet in 2015, Tunisians were more focused on the mounting and daunting challenges of their new reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Street protests never ceased in the aftermath of the toppling of Ben Ali, as discontent with unmet expectations and the performance of the political class continued. Indeed, polls showed a widening gap of distrust &mdash; if not outright rejection &mdash; of the whole ruling elite, by the common man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Appearances notwithstanding, the democratic idea is not out of fashion in Tunisia, even though many have had second thoughts about those they brought to power, most recently in 2019, and the electoral system that made that possible. Freedom remains non-negotiable. Indeed, what Tunisians still yearn for is the very substance of democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in a country beset by economic and health crises, and hit by rising poverty, unemployment and a shrinking middle class, the democratic transition did not usher in a socioeconomic recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a consequence of that, some of the country&rsquo;s nearly 250 political parties &mdash; surely too many; surely an atomization of special interests as opposed to the national need &mdash; shrank in size and stature or simply became extinct. The public&rsquo;s deep distrust of political parties and politicians perhaps is best epitomized by the dramatic drop in support for Ennahda, the main Islamist party, which used to think that it enjoyed &ldquo;Teflon&rdquo; protection from criticism over the part it played in successive governments&rsquo; failures and inept performances since 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all that time, the West seemed to think that economic assistance alone could do the job of rebuilding a new Tunisia. Billions of dollars poured into the country &mdash; though not as much as some had hoped for. But all that it accomplished was to fuel misguided spending and corruption. The aid failed to build jobs that ensure dignity; for many, it even failed to put food on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democracy itself was further tainted by the endless horse trading among politicians and the insults and abuse they heaved on each other in parliament, often carried live on television. This did no small damage to the credibility of the democratic transition and its main actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The West now faces a quandary. Some wonder if reverse engineering might reset the system to the status quo ante and put back on track the same old process &mdash; such is its unalloyed dedication to the formalistic idea of democracy. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, articulating the wishes not just of his government but perhaps also that of Europe, asked Saied to &ldquo;adhere to the principles of democracy and human rights.&rdquo; The statement is a reflection of the West&rsquo;s reductive approach to the problem; one of the reasons it was clearly surprised by developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most detailed prescriptive pronouncement came from Blinken&rsquo;s colleague, Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, who called for the resumption of the democratic process and &ldquo;the timely return of the elected parliament.&rdquo; Tunisian analysts are still parsing the meaning of &ldquo;timely.&rdquo; But there is no ambiguity about the West&rsquo;s insistence that Saied must make clear a strong commitment to democratic rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, a re-commitment to democratic principles should not be difficult. But a resumption of the political process may not necessarily mean a full return to the recent past. Saied, a constitutional jurist, believes the old system to have no redeeming value. An advocate of local government, he has often talked of a bottom-up democracy. He may be tempted to tweak the electoral system accordingly. Speaking to French president Emmanuel Macron, he pledged a quick unveiling of a roadmap and to give a &ldquo;rightful place to popular legitimacy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To that end, he believes that a presidential regime is better fit for the needs of Tunisia &mdash; a system that would give the directly elected leader greater latitude. Such a change would require constitutional amendments and probably a popular referendum in the absence of a sitting parliament. Saied could use his emergency powers to introduce the reforms needed for this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But nothing is yet a done deal. As usual, Saied is proceeding with caution. He has to accommodate two potentially conflicting issues. He must be careful of popular blowback in case he opts for a full U-turn, which would disavow his own verdict that the old system has failed. The other would be the need to avoid any move that risks alienating the West, a crucial economic and security partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of Tunisia and the country&rsquo;s relations with the West will have to be based on acknowledging nuances in Tunisia&rsquo;s social, economic and political culture. It is likely to be made through adjustments and compromises, not confrontation. Failure could be potentially de-stabilizing for the country, with possible repercussions for its immediate neighborhood. Now as before, the pulse on the street might be a better indicator of things to come than theoretical models of transition.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638164689.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'tunisians-want-more-from-democracy-than-just-to-vote-can-saied-deliver', '', '2021-11-29 11:14:49', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

For the leaders in Middle East capitals, it is more like a full-time job. Who the American president chooses to call or meet first can often reveal something of his intentions for the next four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, the call sheet is revealing of future foreign policy. Donald Trump&rsquo;s first call to a Middle East leader was to Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s King Salman, and the two had a close relationship over the next four years. At other times, it is less telling: Barack Obama called Egypt&rsquo;s then-president Hosni Mubarak on his first day in office. Two years later, with protests convulsing Cairo, he called on him to step down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Arab capitals have watched as six months of the new Biden administration passed without a single face-to-face meeting with a leader from the region. In the past two weeks, that has changed: Joe Biden first welcomed Jordan&rsquo;s King Abdullah to the White House, followed by Iraq&rsquo;s prime minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those choices, and what was discussed, are revealing but hardly comforting. Joe Biden is signaling that he is uninterested in solving the &ndash; often dramatic &ndash; problems of the region. Instead, his focus is on the dull, boring political work of finishing the vaccine rollout and rebuilding the physical and human infrastructure of America. This determination leaves little time for Arab allies abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The choice of King Abdullah and Al-Kadhimi is revealing. Both are weak US allies, buffeted by outside forces. Both were looking for strong support from Biden. Both were disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abdullah, the custodian of Jerusalem&rsquo;s holy sites, found himself sidelined during the Trump administration in favor of relations with Israel and Saudi Arabia. By meeting him first, Biden was signaling he intends to return to the steady &ndash; but, frankly, deeply unsatisfactory &ndash; status quo ante.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Al-Kadhimi&rsquo;s situation is more precarious. Weeks away from an election, not only can Iraq&rsquo;s prime minister not rein in Iran-backed militias, but he can&rsquo;t even publicly endorse US airstrikes on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For both, Biden offered little beyond the bare minimum, telling Abdullah &ldquo;you live in a tough neighborhood,&rdquo; and declining to endorse Al-Kadhimi, saying only he was &ldquo;looking forward&rdquo; to seeing an election in October. Those statements were studiously boring, designed to offer little more than a shrug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was reminiscent of his meeting in June with Afghanistan&rsquo;s president when, against a backdrop of warnings of a Taliban takeover, Biden merely said that &ldquo;Afghans will have to decide their own future.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In part, this is a recognition by Biden that the weaknesses of Jordan or Iraq, or the reasons why the Afghan war went badly, are not confined to one year or one administration, but are the result of much longer political trends, trends the US is reluctant &ndash; and may be powerless &ndash; to resolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is also an extension of Obama&rsquo;s view that foreign entanglements are distractions best avoided in pursuing a domestic agenda. Biden studiously avoided the Israel-Palestine question until the Gaza war exploded. He has yet to say anything about a deadly attack on an Israeli-linked tanker off the coast of Oman, blamed on Iran, or the attempted hijacking of an asphalt tanker this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than one American commentator has referred to Biden&rsquo;s first few months in office as &ldquo;building back boring,&rdquo; a play on an erstwhile slogan of &ldquo;building back better&rdquo; and Biden&rsquo;s low-key reputation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But building back boring is time-consuming and, given the tricky mathematics of the house of representatives and senate, requires focus and dedication. Biden is trying to push through a vast infrastructure plan. Foreign entanglements are costly, not only in money but especially in political attention, and the new president is determined to avoid them. Even when he ordered airstrikes against militia groups in Iraq in June, there was no thundering speech in front of the cameras; it was left to the Pentagon press office to issue a statement confirming the strikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With little fanfare, Biden is drawing a close on the War on Terror years. He has withdrawn from Afghanistan and will end combat missions in Iraq &ndash; that was the main announcement of his meeting with Al-Kadhimi, although there was no press conference in the Rose Garden to declare it, and no &ldquo;Mission Accomplished&rdquo; banner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the same day Jordan&rsquo;s Abdullah arrived in Washington, the Pentagon announced a detainee from Guantanamo Bay had been transferred home for the first time, suggesting the controversial facility may finally be closed. This is the dull genius of Biden&rsquo;s presidency, quietly extricating himself from the wars of his predecessors, while planning to spend vast sums on rebuilding at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The message to the Middle East may have taken six months to be delivered, but it was unmistakably harsh, especially to traditional allies like Jordan who are hoping for more US involvement, not less. And the message was this: America may support you, but its days of leading from the front in the Middle East are over.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638164746.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'bidens-building-back-boring-leaves-little-time-for-arab-allies', '', '2021-11-29 11:15:46', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(167, 4, 12, 'Why Tunisia Is in Crisis', NULL, NULL, '<p>Tunisia is in a deep political crisis. If president&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/tunisia-parliament-is-in-crisis/\">Kais Saied</a>&nbsp;lives up to his promise of restoring the fledgling democracy&rsquo;s political system within one month, it will be a miracle. In such turbulent situations, positions can harden and the conditions that would permit lifting the suspension of normal political functions are rarely met. Add to the mix the apparent role of larger or stronger Arab states with an agenda to bring Tunisia into the regional mainstream that is not democratic or tolerant of diverse political views, and it&rsquo;s hard to see a happy ending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was it a coup? This is a question that is sometimes important because it has a strong bearing on how foreign countries react to events such as those in Tunisia. Usually, a &ldquo;coup&rdquo; requires an upending of the established order by removing the authority at the top and replacing it. In this case, the incumbent leader simply grabbed more power, and suspended the functions of the other power centers. Moreover, Saied insists he has not abandoned the constitution. These events may fit into the category of autogolpe, the &ldquo;self-coup&rdquo; where legally elected political figures act against their own institutions to redefine the political system in their favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tunisia&rsquo;s Western aid donors and friends have an interest, actually, in avoiding the question altogether. In the US case, its refusal to call Egypt&rsquo;s ousting of elected president Mohamed Morsi in 2012 a coup, let Washington continue to provide aid and to use that as leverage to try to effect a transition back to more democratic behavior. In that case, the strategy failed. But many friends of Tunisia are both highly critical of Saied&rsquo;s actions, yet eager to see aid continue to flow to save Tunisia&rsquo;s fragile economy and collapsing health sector. So the debate over what to call the events of July 25 may be academic in this case, as foreign governments weigh what can be done to get the country back on a democratic path and to address some of its acute problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be useful to make the distinction between Tunisia&rsquo;s democratic culture and the lack of competence of its democratic governance. On the cultural side, there are signs that Tunisians still believe they live in a democratic system, and have a voice and choice in how they are governed. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s clear that the institutional part of democratic practice remains weak. But that may not mean Tunisia is on a slippery slope back to dictatorship. Saied has not taken steps seen in other backsliding states, such as the disbanding of political parties and detention of their leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or at least not yet. For he has undoubtedly begun to follow the autocrats&rsquo; playbook, accusing political parties and some businessmen of corruption and foreign ties, and intimidating media professionals. And he might find traction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many former authoritarian states, the rocky years of building more credible and transparent governance often generate nostalgia for the more predictable life under law-and-order regimes. This is the situation with the mukhabarat states of the Middle East, where civilian power and the security forces work together to suppress freedom of expression and political activism. Indeed, reporters in Tunisia see considerable support for Saied among the populace, many of whom are fed up with the government&rsquo;s poor performance of late. As Oussama Romdhani, editor of The Arab Weekly and a former Tunisian government official explains, &ldquo;Tunisians are not indifferent to democracy except that democratic procedures take a second seat when the citizens feel their livelihood and their long-term stability are in jeopardy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, will Tunisia become another Egypt, where the changes wrought by the Arab Spring have been completely reversed? Tunisia, compared to other Arab states, has a less dominant security sector, and its army behaved honorably in the weeks that led to the ouster of former president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, refusing to fire on unarmed civilians. It is therefore disturbing to read that Egyptian security forces may be advising the Tunisian government during this difficult time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the early days of the Arab Spring and the post-Ben Ali era, Tunisia&rsquo;s new political class did not grasp the centrality of economics and the critical need to demonstrate to the people that their lives would improve in material ways in a democratic system. Many were simply unschooled in the complexities of banking and regulatory reforms, or were complacent about the costs of state control and crony capitalism on the country&rsquo;s growth potential. A decade after its peaceful transition to democracy, Tunisia&rsquo;s economy is hurting badly, and the politicians seem more focused on their personal and inter-party power struggles than making hard choices that would lead to more jobs and a more open economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it was the added misery of Covid-19 that may have been the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back. Tunisia now has the second-highest death rate on a per capita basis in the world, and the figure of 20,000 dead may more than triple in coming weeks. Its medical system is under enormous strain, and the economic stresses of shutdown have led to even greater physical and material suffering in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to see a smooth path to stability in the short run; the stresses on the country could lead to domestic unrest, or new waves of radicalization among young people. Tunisia, paradoxically, contributed disproportionately to the ranks of ISIS, even while it was doing more to build a democratic culture than elsewhere in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saied, a constitutional scholar and social conservative, does not appear to be a visionary or inspiring leader. It&rsquo;s not clear if he has the courage and conviction to reassure the country and its partners in Europe and the US that he has not abandoned the democratic path for Tunisia. The country needs help with Covid and with securing an IMF agreement, but unless Saied can live up to his pledge to make his actions very temporary, Tunisia&rsquo;s people and Tunisia&rsquo;s role as an aspirational model for the region will be the losers.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638164846.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'why-tunisia-is-in-crisis', '', '2021-11-29 11:17:26', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Footages of fire consuming trees and threatening some of the most idyllic coastal towns have dominated social media. Government action in the face of this, however, has been incompetent. And for every example of such incompetence, there are heroic images of citizens fighting the fires with everything they have, often at great risk to themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has been a terrible year for forest fires in the Mediterranean. Greece, Italy and Cyprus along with Turkey have suffered intense heat, drought and other effects of climate change. Turkey has, however, been caught completely unprepared, despite all the signs that calamity was in the cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Erdogan administration, it appears, has no fire-fighting air assets to speak of. Most of its planes have not been serviced and are unsafe. As one independent columnist, Fehim Tastekin, pointed out, Greece has mobilized 39 aerial tankers to fight fires. Turkey has none, and is hoping that Russian and Spanish aircraft will come to help. This state of affairs has been compared to Erdogan&rsquo;s 13-plane presidential fleet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no question that this crisis and its mismanagement by Erdogan will take a tremendous toll on Turkish political stability and weaken the president&rsquo;s hold. This, in turn, may force Erdogan to resort to desperate measures inside or outside the country in an effort to divert attention and rally people around him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the root of the problem is Turkey&rsquo;s political system, which has become the sole province of one man and one man only. Erdogan transformed a parliamentary tradition into a centralized presidential system where he makes just about every decision. As Turkey has become more authoritarian under his tutelage, citizens have had to endure his wrath. Anyone who crosses him can find himself or herself detained, investigated and eventually sentenced to prison. Politicians, mayors, journalists, civil-society leaders and academics have all tasted his &ldquo;justice.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Underlying his rule is a system of sycophancy. He is surrounded by yes-men who tend to sing his praises no matter what the circumstances. The press, too, has come under tremendous economic pressure as Erdogan directs state and even private advertising only to those who back him. Often, daily newspapers appear with the same headlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, Erdogan is cut off from independent and unbiased advice. He is increasingly prone to making mistakes, some large and others small, but all politically important. Among his big mistakes is the decision to purchase Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles, which has led to an irresolvable crisis with the United States. Faced with his party&rsquo;s loss of the Istanbul mayoralty in municipal elections, he conjured up the existence of irregularities and had the election rerun, only to be humiliated as the citizens of Istanbul delivered his party, the AKP, an even bigger loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even in the current wildfire crisis, commonsense seems to have taken leave. Erdogan was filmed entering Marmaris, one of the beleaguered cities, with a convoy of over a hundred cars, buses, police cars, ambulances and fire engines, creating a logistical nightmare and unnecessary traffic jam. Later, he threw packets of tea to Marmaris citizens, who by the way tend to be much better off than those in many other parts of the country. The image of Erdogan disbursing tea, as if it were a great humanitarian gesture, will forever be engraved in many Turks&rsquo; mind. Already, people are having a field day. Some have renamed his AKP as AKPartea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, when in trouble, Erdogan can always rely on conspiracy theories, for which Turkey has always been fertile ground. He has already, without any evidence, pointed to the PKK, the Kurdish insurgent group that is classified as a terrorist organization, as the source of the fires. This was a signal for his minions in the press to embellish the conspiracy to include Greece and Turkey&rsquo;s main, and mostly hapless, opposition party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conspiracies, in fact, are simply too alluring for many Turks. Even a columnist in an anti-Erdogan paper has suggested that the fires were a &ldquo;trap&rdquo; the US put in place in the aftermath of World War II, when it provided Turkey with aid through the Marshall Plan. Apparently, the US uprooted many olive and other similar trees, replacing them with poplars and pine trees that are exceedingly flammable. Adding more conspiracy to the mix, Erdogan&rsquo;s communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, said that the large volume of protests on social media was part of a foreign plot to portray Turkey as weak and originated from a &ldquo;single center overseas.&rdquo; While it is not clear where this &ldquo;single center&rdquo; is located, in the past this has been a signal to mean the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But conspiracy theories won&rsquo;t help Erdogan this time. Social media has already overwhelmed the government&rsquo;s efforts at controlling the narrative. The devastation and the general lackadaisical attitude of some ministers, when compared with the efforts of ordinary citizens, and, more importantly, the absence of any planning and preparation by the government, will severely undermine its future narrative and ability to set the agenda. Erdogan will only be going through the motion of governing; the emperor has no clothes, they burned along with forests and trees and homes.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638164921.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'as-turkeys-wildfires-rage-conspiracy-theories-wont-help-erdogan', '', '2021-11-29 11:18:41', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

France even insists that mothers remain behind in the camps if they want their children repatriated, although it is unclear if any have agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Belgium originally maintained the same policy and accepted only children, but has softened its stance. As Belgium begins to repatriate adults &ndash; and there could be as many as 400 of them in northern Syria &ndash; pressure on its neighbors to do the same will grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking back European citizens who joined ISIS is little short of a nightmare scenario for governments. The Belgium case is the thin end of the wedge: in the hierarchy of detainees the public can accept, orphans and mothers with young children are at the top. They are followed, at some distance, by those who claim to have been non-combatants or there under duress, so-called &ldquo;jihadi brides.&rdquo;Finally, there are the adult fighters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Governments worry &ndash; not unreasonably &ndash; that once the firewall against accepting adults is breached, hundreds of detainees will have to be returned. Even if they are prosecuted, the muddled complexity of every court case will be carried out in full view of the media &ndash; every lenient sentence, every acquittal, every lack of remorse will constitute a political firestorm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The firewall is crumbling in part because of pressure from the United States. When America&rsquo;s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was in Europe for Joe Biden&rsquo;s first visit last month, he publicly called the refusal of EU countries to take back their citizens &ldquo;untenable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American pressure on European countries to repatriate detainees is one of the policies of the Trump administration that the Biden government has continued. Donald Trump once threatened to &ldquo;release [ISIS fighters] into the countries from which they came,&rdquo; if European countries didn&rsquo;t take them themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of this is a tussle between European intelligence services and the US military. The former is concerned at the vast cost of monitoring hundreds of fighters, wives and children, most of whom will not be prosecutable because of the degraded standard of battlefield evidence. The latter &ndash; the US sent relatively few fighters &ndash; are concerned that those left in camps will eventually become a military problem that they will be called upon to fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is also crumbling because of pressure from Turkey. Starting at the end of 2019, Turkey has taken a harder line on ISIS fighters and their families inside Turkey, deporting those held in its prisons, sometimes with very little warning, to Germany, France, the US and the UK. Once these countries accepted the principle of taking back detainees from Turkey, it became harder to argue they shouldn&rsquo;t also take detainees held a few kilometers across the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For years, European governments have hoped that the problem would go away, or at least be deferred for so long it would become someone else&rsquo;s problem. But the public stance taken by the United States, and now the repatriation of Belgium citizens, significantly changes the calculation. Sooner or later, most European citizens will have to leave northern Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is good news for the Assad regime. Since the start of the uprising, the regime has sought to &ldquo;externalize&rdquo; the costs of the war against its people. Millions of Syrians have fled and become refugees abroad. Now those who came from abroad to fight in Syria are leaving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a more sinister political benefit for the regime. With US troops gone from the border, and now European citizens being repatriated, Western countries will have less reason to be concerned about what happens in northeastern Syria. The Kurdish region is one of only two areas of the country beyond regime control. Al-Assad&rsquo;s war to reclaim it &ndash; which he vowed again to do in his inauguration speech &ndash; will be easier to conduct once Europe&rsquo;s unwanted citizens go home.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165002.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'europes-jihadi-firewall-begins-to-crumble', '', '2021-11-29 11:20:02', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Despite the outrage expressed by various media outlets and opposition groups with political axes to grind, it can&rsquo;t, surely, be the simple fact that it&rsquo;s happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the 2005 London attacks, the 2015 Paris attacks and the Bardo Museum killings in Tunisia the same year, the 2017 Manchester Arena bomb and numerous other terrorist outrages, including this week&rsquo;s murder of at least 30 people in Baghdad, the real scandal would be if security forces everywhere weren&rsquo;t doing everything in their power to head off such attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, like it or loathe it, we live in an age of mass surveillance. Each one of us is tracked and monitored every day, online and in the real world, by governments and companies alike. To express surprise at the existence and use of sophisticated smartphone spyware is simply disingenuous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps, then, the shock lies in the revelation that many of the countries have used the software developed by Israeli firm NSO to target journalists. Journalists, we are told by journalists, should be exempt from this sort of snooping. But why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Journalists are targeted because they are in contact with the very people on whom governments wish to keep tabs &ndash; dissidents and rebels make for good copy. What isn&rsquo;t clear, however, is why journalists should cry &ldquo;foul&rdquo; when a government takes advantage of the backdoor into the world of dissent that many journalists carelessly leave wide open. Protecting a source has always meant refusing to disclose their identity, even in the face of official threats. In 2005, for example, US journalist Judith Miller served 85 days in jail after refusing to reveal her source for the story that so-called energy consultant Valerie Plame was a CIA analyst involved in investigating claims that Iraq was trying to develop a nuclear weapon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Journalists have a duty to protect their sources, and today the only safe way to interview an at-risk subject is either in person, and in private, or by using a cheap mobile phone with a prepaid SIM card, fresh out of the box and straight into the bin when the call is over. Anyone who has ever watched a spy film knows this. To rely on governments to do the &ldquo;decent thing&rdquo; &ndash; and then complain later when it turns out that they didn&rsquo;t &ndash; is both naive and a dereliction of that duty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Predictably, much of the coverage in 17 selected Western media organizations that have been fed information about Pegasus by the Paris-based non-profit, Forbidden Stories, and Amnesty International has been targeted at Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the traditional b&ecirc;tes noires of the virtue-signaling classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strangely, however, the UK&rsquo;s Guardian newspaper&rsquo;s enthusiastic coverage of the supposed transgressions of the Gulf states appeared to be blighted by short-term memory loss. There was no mention of the fact that as far back as 2018 the University of Toronto&rsquo;s Citizen Lab identified 45 countries that were using NSO&rsquo;s Pegasus system, including the UK, Canada, France, the Netherlands and the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small wonder, then, that NSO&rsquo;s advisors have included Beacon Global Strategies, a Washington consulting firm run by a former CIA and Pentagon chief of staff and former staffers from the House intelligence committee and the US state department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The political fallout whipped up by the revelations has been as noisy as it was predictable, and characterized chiefly by hypocrisy. In India, Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government, which is suspected of having used Pegasus to spy on &ldquo;several journalists, activists and an opposition election strategist,&rdquo; has been accused of treason and &ldquo;unforgivable sacrilege&rdquo; by the political opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would the opposition have allowed the security services to take advantage of the technology were it in power? Certainly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would it accuse the government of having dropped the intelligence ball in the wake of a terrorist outrage? Of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around the world, one of the benefits of being in opposition is that one can have it both ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But of all the sanctimonious coverage of the past week, it was the reliance on one Edward Snowden for commentary on just how awful the use of NSO technology by governments was that stank the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source of the leak of the 50,000 telephone numbers has yet to emerge. But which country has the most to gain from the divisive fallout from the revelations? Could it be Russia, conspicuously absent from the list of countries supposedly implicated by the leak?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As evidenced by countless activities, including its interference in the US elections and attempted sabotage of the Nato alliance and the European Union, Russia is devoted to the disruption of international relationships, the better to extend its power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So too, by association, is Edward Snowden, the former US national security agency intelligence consultant-turned-traitor who in 2013 fled to Russia, where he has been granted lifetime sanctuary. Snowden&rsquo;s showboating revelations compromised national security in multiple countries, endangered the lives of countless agents and handed terrorists a training manual on how to avoid detection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The journalists who disseminated the information Snowden leaked won multiple awards, as doubtless will those who are currently &ldquo;exposing&rdquo; the activities of governments seeking to protect their citizens in an extremely dangerous world. Launching its series on Pegasus earlier this week, the Guardian said, &ldquo;We believe the public should know that NSO&rsquo;s technology is being abused by the governments who license and operate its spyware.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The citizens of those countries, however, might consider that the technology is being correctly used by their governments in an entirely justifiable attempt to protect them from harm &ndash; a thankless task, it seems, for which they will win no awards.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165109.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'journalistic-hypocrisy-in-the-pegasus-spyware-revelation', '', '2021-11-29 11:21:49', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(171, 4, 13, '‘It All Crystalized for Me When My Family Caught Covid-19’', NULL, NULL, '<p>Many parts of the developing world continue to struggle to contain&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/covax-failure-colonial-era-privilege-hampers-fight-against-covid-19/\">Covid-19</a>, even as the West begins to open back up. I live in South Africa, and my family came down with Covid two weeks ago. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t such a great surprise, since almost everyone we know here has had one or more family members infected. But it became clear to me, as we continue to self-isolate at home, that in the face of the delta variant of the coronavirus, the West must realize that it is only if it abandons its vaccine selfishness can it truly provide security to its own population. We in the Global South must be vaccinated too if those in the Global North want to get back their normal life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened to my family. With the onset of winter in the southern hemisphere, children of all ages are getting wintertime sniffles. When our two-and-a-half-year-old son came down with a fever and cough three weeks ago, we thought it was a run-of-the-mill toddler cold. Then, the cold spread to my wife and our son&rsquo;s caregiver. The penny dropped when my wife lost her sense of taste and smell, and a subsequent test confirmed that she had contracted Covid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From our experience, the most frightening thing about the delta variant is that it shows up in children like a typical winter cold. Our son was the likely vector of our family&rsquo;s infection. There is no way to be sure, but we haven&rsquo;t been out much since South Africa reentered lockdown to combat the current wave of infection. Our son, however, has been going to his playgroup with other kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our doctor tells us that any case of cold he sees in children this winter is being treated as Covid. Thus, not only is the delta variant almost 60 percent more transmissible than the original strain of Covid, but it seems to be affecting children. (Thankfully, our family is doing fine as the virus is manifesting in everyone at home like a mild flu.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Current infections across South Africa as a result of the delta variant have outpaced the previous two infection peaks in 2020. Experts from the World Health Organization have warned that infections also have increased for the past six weeks across the rest of Africa. Because of ample testing capacity, South Africa accounts for more than half of those identified cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the high transmissibility of the delta variant, the reason South Africa finds itself battling another infection wave is a result of the glacial pace of vaccination. Out of a population of 60 million, only 3 million doses of vaccine have been administered. According to the WHO, in the rest of the continent only 15 million people are fully vaccinated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is conceivable that with a vast number of people still highly susceptible to Covid, new variants will emerge to join the alpha, beta, delta and other existing variants. That&rsquo;s why we need everyone everywhere on Earth to be quickly vaccinated. There is no way to know how effective our existing vaccines will be against new forms of the virus, so we must end the spread of existing forms before they mutate further. All this, and the fact that children are no longer immune &ndash; yet no toddler anywhere is eligible for vaccination &ndash; drives home the dangerous nature of the problem we all face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary handicap to vaccination across a wider geography has been the failure of the Covax vaccine-sharing program, as a result of Western countries&rsquo; rewriting of rules to their benefit. Through this, they gazumped more than their fair share of vaccines. Developed nations also negotiated directly with potential vaccine makers before their products were approved. The result is that the supply pipeline currently is mostly pointed West.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way out of this mess is to have more vaccine production lines. We need more vaccine factories because the current ones have already committed their supplies for many months ahead. For Africa, a continent with just 1.2 percent of its population inoculated, there must be African vaccine plants. To that end, it is reassuring that South Africa sealed a historic agreement late last month with Johnson &amp; Johnson to manufacture its one-jab vaccine. But the continent needs much more of this if infections are going to be controlled soon before new variants have an opportunity to mutate into life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Covid-19 is not going to be the last virus to wreak havoc. Africa needs the ability to develop vaccines for the future. The initiative by the WHO and France to transfer technology related to messenger RNA vaccines to South Africa is a step in the right direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But of course, all of that takes time, when there is an easier, immediate way of getting Africa and the rest of the Global South vaccinated. And that is for the Global North to give us the vaccines it isn&rsquo;t using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only swift path out of rising infections and lockdowns is deliberate international action that includes a global campaign in which wealthier countries assist developing nations with vaccine access. If the Global North wants to be able to continue to visit bars and sports events, to go to cinemas and to visit family, it needs to ensure that we in the Global South are just as protected as they are. Otherwise, there will almost surely be new variants to come that will escape the neutralizing effect of our current crop of vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for my wife and I, we learned last month that we might get our first vaccine shot in August. But that&rsquo;s all rather academic now.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165226.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'it-all-crystalized-for-me-when-my-family-caught-covid-19', '', '2021-11-29 11:23:46', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

It is, after all, a term more at home in news headlines than in serious academic publications. But the first great water war of the 21st century is precisely the &ldquo;risk&rdquo; in question, and in the Horn of Africa that risk is on the cusp of becoming a tragic reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the surprise of no one with even half an eye on developments in the region, at the very top of the list of potential global flashpoints identified by the researchers was the Nile basin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/tigray-victories-ethiopia/\">Addis Ababa</a>&nbsp;dismisses the protests of Sudan and Egypt and presses ahead with filling the reservoir behind its mighty Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which in the process will hold back a significant portion of the water that would normally flow downstream along the Blue Nile, it is difficult to see how the standoff between the three players can be resolved peacefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 8, the UN Security Council urged the three countries &ldquo;to arrive at a cooperative solution, in pursuit of sustainable development for all in the spirit of &lsquo;one river, one people, one vision.&rsquo;&rdquo; That is a vain hope. Despite the well-meaning intervention of organizations from the African Union to the Arab League, to say nothing of recent diplomatic interventions by Gulf states and the new US administration, a cooperative solution is precisely what the three countries have consistently failed to achieve for the past 10 years, ever since Ethiopia first announced its plan to build the vast hydroelectric dam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one can argue reasonably that Ethiopia, a country in which half the population has no access to electricity, shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to exploit the natural resource that originates on its territory. Likewise, who can suggest that Egypt should be deprived of even a drop of the water upon which it has depended for its existence for millennia?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competing needs appear incompatible. But this is only the beginning of the intractable water crisis that is brewing in the Nile basin. There are no fewer than 11 nations and 260 million people &ndash; some 58 percent of the total &ndash; utterly dependent upon the waters of the Nile. Over the next 25 years, predicts the UN, the populations of those 11 nations will increase by at least 50 percent. The average volume of water that flows along the Nile, meanwhile, will not increase by a single drop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worse, several of the nations of the Nile Basin, inspired by Ethiopia&rsquo;s success in building Africa&rsquo;s largest hydroelectric dam, understandably want dams of their own as their populations grow and demand for modernization and electricity soars. Last month, South Sudan announced plans for a dam that would straddle the White Nile, also upstream of Sudan and Egypt, threatening to deprive the downstream states of yet more water. Ethiopia itself also has plans for at least three more dams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its 10-year strategy, published in 2017 in an ill-fated bid to ensure &ldquo;cooperation and joint action between the riparian countries, seeking win-win gains,&rdquo; the Nile Basin Initiative predicted that &ldquo;if countries develop as planned, we will need 1.5 Niles by 2050.&rdquo; That now seems like an underestimate and, in any case, it&rsquo;s a purely academic one &ndash; there are no more Niles available. The NBI&rsquo;s slogan &ndash; &ldquo;One river, one people, one vision&rdquo; &ndash; rings ever hollow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those urging Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia to talk their way to a resolution of the crisis, to somehow find a way to manage the Nile as an international, transboundary resource, rather than as an asset to be exploited by individual nations determined to operate in their own self-interest, must face a sobering reality. Even in an imaginary ideal world, in which all the 11 nations of the Nile Basin were a single state, managing the great rivers as a unified resource, there could still be no solution to the fundamental problem that now threatens to overwhelm the security of the Horn of Africa and, as a result, the wider region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are simply too many people, with more arriving every day, and not enough water to go around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worst-case scenarios can be found in little-read academic papers authored by Egyptian academics. For Egypt, any significant loss of water from the Nile would mean devastation of its agricultural economy and joblessness on a vast scale, attended by famine, civil unrest and a refugee crisis that would see millions flee the country, with consequences for neighboring states and a revival of the horrors of the Mediterranean exodus that reached its peak in 2016 with over 5,000 deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this, of course, comes against a backdrop of multiple tensions in the region, from the ongoing political crisis in Somalia to the bitter conflict in Ethiopia&rsquo;s Tigray region. In April, Jeffrey Feltman, the newly appointed US special envoy for the Horn of Africa, predicted that, with over 110 million people, &ldquo;if the tensions in Ethiopia result in a widespread civil conflict that goes beyond Tigray, Syria will look like child&rsquo;s play by comparison.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To that scenario, just add water and you have the recipe for a regional disaster on an unprecedented scale.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165282.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'a-water-war-simmers-in-the-horn-of-africa', '', '2021-11-29 11:24:42', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

For Ethiopia&rsquo;s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/ethiopias-tigray-conflict-threatens-to-spill-over/\">rebels</a>&rsquo; gains are also a stark warning that unless he engages with them, the future of his country can only get bleaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TPLF&rsquo;s control over Tigray poses an existential threat to Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea&rsquo;s authoritarian president. The TPLF and Isaias have been sworn enemies ever since Isaias led the Eritrean People&rsquo;s Liberation Front to defeat by the TPLF-dominated Ethiopian army in the 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war. The feud has now reached the point where neither the Isaias regime in Asmara nor the TPLF in Tigray is willing to tolerate the other&rsquo;s existence. Indeed, several TPLF leaders have threatened to cross the border into Eritrea and oust the president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TPLF already has lobbed missiles into Asmara, the Eritrean capital. Another defeat at the hands of the TPLF will be damaging to an already unpopular Isaias, which explains why the TPLF has openly called for retreating Eritrean soldiers to defect and join the anti-Isaias opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If nothing else, the conflict has put paid to the notion of Ethiopia and Eritrea forming any sort of confederation. This was long thought to be a joint plan by Abiy and Isaias to give Ethiopia access to Eritrea&rsquo;s Red Sea ports and allow Isaias to fulfill his ambition of becoming a regional leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TPLF has also declared its intention to evict the Amhara militias that currently control territory in western Tigray. This will also give the TPLF control over the border with Sudan and, through that, access to arms supplies. Egypt, which recently signed a military cooperation agreement with Sudan, is likely to encourage this to put pressure on Addis Ababa on the issue of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the free flow of weapons through Sudan can only destabilize a country that is going through its own political transition. Ethiopia has in the past supported Sudanese rebel groups and could use those to foment instability, which Sudan can ill afford. There have already been clashes over the last year on the Sudan-Ethiopia border and Abiy has used the increased tension with Sudan to explain why he has withdrawn troops from Tigray. Presented as a nationalist cause, this could also be what Abiy needs to ensure his political survival. For Sudan, it could severely undermine its fragile political transition and potentially lead to renewed conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The war also has had repercussions in Somalia, Ethiopia&rsquo;s eastern neighbor. At the start of the conflict, Addis Ababa withdrew a third of its peacekeeping contingent from Somalia. These troops played a crucial role in propping up the government of president Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo. The resulting security vacuum in Somalia could embolden the jihadis of Al-Shabaab, further destabilizing the entire Horn of Africa region. Turkey, which maintains security ties to Farmaajo&rsquo;s government, is then likely to step into the breach, setting the stage for Somalia to become yet another proxy battleground for the region&rsquo;s competing power blocs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as domestic politics is concerned, a Tigray province entirely controlled by the TPLF will only embolden Ethiopia&rsquo;s other ethnic insurgencies. Abiy has sought political support from Amhara militias to counter rising disaffection against him from Ethiopia&rsquo;s other ethnic groups, including his own, the Oromo. But if the TPLF drives Amhara militias out of western Tigray, Abiy&rsquo;s putative alliance with Amhara groups becomes untenable. The fact is that the reason Amhara militias got involved in the Tigray war in the first place has less to do with Ethiopian nationalism and more to do with reclaiming what Amhara nationalists claim is Amhara land within Tigray province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democratic politics, which ought to work as a safety valve for a combustible multiethnic country like Ethiopia, lies in tatters. Abiy&rsquo;s government has just organized a sham national election that was boycotted by most opposition parties. Twenty percent of voters could not vote and there were no elections held at all in a fifth of the parliamentary constituencies. This free but unfair election took place against the backdrop of several arrests of opposition politicians and a clampdown on the media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In effect, the political process to remake the Ethiopian state &ndash; Abiy&rsquo;s professed goal when he took office &ndash; is dead. Instead, Abiy and his Prosperity Party preside over a state with one dominant party and opposition parties that are no more than showpieces. His government has little electoral legitimacy and its focus will be on maintaining power, rather than addressing the country&rsquo;s myriad challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure his political survival, Abiy has turned to the GERD issue. On July 6, Addis Ababa announced that the filling of the dam would resume, leading to protests from Egypt. The move is no more than a cynical attempt to foment nationalism. But it is unlikely to work; Ethiopia is too riven by rising ethnic tensions and a tanking economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, it would serve Abiy better to address concerns about human rights abuses and the denial of aid to Tigray&rsquo;s beleaguered population. This would at least open up the door to the financial aid the country so badly needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is still a small window of opportunity for Abiy to engage in meaningful discussions with the TPLF and other opposition groups about the future of the Ethiopian state. Anything less will merely push all its various conflicts on to the back burner where they will simmer away or, worse, boil over. Abiy must seize the moment, for the sake of his country and the entire region.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165336.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'rebel-victories-in-tigray-are-a-watershed-moment-for-ethiopia', '', '2021-11-29 11:25:36', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

So, while the previous president, Beji Caid Essebsi, created the Nidaa Tounes party explicitly as a counterweight to the popular Islamist party, Ennahda, in 2015 it ended up in a coalition with Ennahda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, however, elections brought in the country&rsquo;s most fractured government to date, with the largest party, Ennahda, receiving only a quarter of the seats in parliament and 23 parties winning three or fewer seats. Most strikingly, president Kais Saied was elected with an overwhelming majority of 73 percent, despite having no political party or clear constituency and after doing very little campaigning &ndash; a sign of public frustration with the new establishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The country is growing increasingly polarized. The centrist parties that once dominated Tunisia now are being overshadowed by extremist forces on both sides of the aisle. On one side is Abir Moussi and her Free Destourian party, who seek a return to the dictatorial rule of the Zine El Abidine Ben Ali era and the end of the democratic transition. On the other is Seif El-Din Makhlouf and his Karama coalition, a Salafist bloc pushing for a greater role for Islam. The philosophical divide between the two is stark, but most troubling is the growing trend of violent and vicious attacks within the halls of parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On June 30, Moussi suffered two violent attacks in one day, both during active plenary sessions &ndash; first by independent MP Sahbi Samara and later by Makhlouf. These attacks not only disrupt parliament&rsquo;s work and prevent it from carrying out crucial economic and social reforms, but they also contribute to a plummeting level of trust between the public and their elected officials. And while most Tunisian politicians still support democracy, Moussi and her Free Destourian party are growing in popularity, with calls for a return to the Ben Ali era resonating more and more with Tunisians who are unable to feed themselves or their families and see little tangible benefit from the revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of the halls of parliament, the president and the prime minister are in a feud, as Saied seeks to consolidate power in the hands of the presidency and to undermine the role of the prime minister. Saied is, arguably, the biggest obstacle to Tunisia&rsquo;s success today. By refusing to sign off on a recent government reshuffle, he has left 11 cabinet offices without a minister, including the ministry of interior, which prime minister Hichem Mechichi is currently overseeing in addition to his regular duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saied has also placed impediments in front of all the major reform efforts, including a refusal to sign off on parliament&rsquo;s chosen members of the constitutional court &ndash; the country&rsquo;s highest judicial body. The court has the power to adjudicate disputes between the presidency and the government, and would likely prevent Saied from carrying out his attempts at dismantling parliament and the prime minister&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The polarization and political infighting have very serious implications for the stability of Tunisia. The country is in urgent need of international assistance and is actively seeking a new IMF agreement. It is facing billions of dollars of debt that will come due in the next few months. But with a government incapable of coming to agreement on the IMF&rsquo;s conditions or on how to bring relief to the poorest Tunisians, there is little hope for a solution in the short term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The country&rsquo;s political leaders should acknowledge publicly and loudly how dire the political and economic crises are and make every attempt to put aside their differences to get to work implementing necessary economic reforms. Additionally, parliament and the prime minister should recognize Saied for what he is &ndash; a populist who is actively contributing to his country&rsquo;s crises &ndash; and go around him by working directly with donors to secure Covid-19 vaccines and bring in emergency healthcare supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any effort that Tunisia&rsquo;s political class can make to overcome the vicious and violent nature of Tunisian politics today will help return the faith of the donors that Tunisia so desperately needs to overcome the triple crises it faces today.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165378.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'tunisia-is-in-trouble', '', '2021-11-29 11:26:18', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Aside from alarm over what appears to be a thaw in relations between the region&rsquo;s two most bitter rivals, pro-Iran militias everywhere are crowing about Iran&rsquo;s &ldquo;victory&rdquo; over the Saudis. The reality is that there is no such victory in sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraq hosted two sessions of the talks, in April and May, and Oman is likely to be the venue for a third, as yet unscheduled, meeting. The choice of Oman, traditionally the region&rsquo;s mediator, would appear to bode well for progress, but assigning winners and losers would be premature. Iranian officials have said the talks &ldquo;have achieved good progress&rdquo; but warned that some issues &ldquo;may have complexities that take time to resolve,&rdquo; without naming what those disputed issues might be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s no great mystery there. Iran&rsquo;s regional policy is based on its unwavering ideological antagonism toward the West in general and the US in particular, and has long felt that relations between the Gulf nations and the US are far too cosy. For Tehran, the presence of American forces in the Gulf and the wider Middle East is an abomination that cannot, and must not, be tolerated. The Abraham Accords, which established diplomatic relations between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, only inflamed Iranian outrage further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This indignation is entirely self-serving. Tehran sees the withdrawal of US troops as an opportunity to change the security architecture of the region. As the US pulls out, Islamist Iran steps in to fill the void and bully its Arab neighbors even more. Some American voices concur that the US presence in the Gulf &ndash; which dates back to the Carter presidency following the overthrow of the Shah in 1979 &ndash; has run its course. Writing in Foreign Affairs magazine, senator Chris Murphy all but said it was time for the US to leave the region and hand the keys over to Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian officials have used every opportunity to restate this view. At the seventh biennial conference of the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium, held in June on Mayotte and Reunion, two French-administered islands near Madagascar, the Iranian naval commander, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, met with his French counterpart, Pierre Vandier. According to Iranian media, Khanzadi made clear his country&rsquo;s position: maritime security in any region was a matter for the sovereign states in that region, therefore American and European naval forces should remove themselves from the waters &ldquo;near Iran&rsquo;s southern coast.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a sovereign state, Iran has every right to assert authority over its own territory, but that extends for only 12 nautical miles off its shoreline. Tehran has no authority to prevent, obstruct or even protest against any other nation&rsquo;s vessels sailing in international waters or the territorial waters of other Gulf states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two aspects hovering in the background to this putative Saudi-Iranian rapprochement. First there is the possible revival of the JCPOA, more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have always opposed it but seem resigned to the fact that the Biden administration will restore it. Negotiations in Vienna were taking place even as the Saudis and Iranians were meeting in Iraq. Iran needs to convince its Gulf neighbors that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there is the matter of Yemen, which was the focus of the first two rounds of talks. Saudi Arabia has invested many resources in the war in Yemen for six years to no great avail. Put simply, the Saudis need a way out of Yemen. With the mood in the Biden administration less dependable than it was under his predecessor, the Saudis are obliged to try another tack. However, the talks are unlikely to achieve much if Iran continues to ignore the limits of its authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The removal of the Shah in 1979 broke the Iran-US alliance. It also cost Iran global recognition as the region&rsquo;s policeman. As the new regime in Tehran set about sowing discord and destabilizing the region, the world&rsquo;s major powers strengthened their presence in the Gulf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As is all too evident from the havoc wreaked by pro-Iran militias in Yemen and Lebanon, Iran still harbors ambitions to regain its former status as the main regional power, but not through cooperation with its Arab neighbors and the West. Instead, the strategy is to achieve those ambitions through blackmail, intimidation, by sponsoring militias, fomenting proxy wars and sending out drones armed with explosives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The unresolved &ldquo;complexities&rdquo; the Iranians referred to following the two earlier talks with the Saudis are, in fact, not complex at all: they want the American military out, and Iran in as the undisputed new sheriff in town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Iran could learn to behave like a sovereign state and not a disseminator of revolution, if it could respect the sovereignty of its neighbors and forsake expansionism, a breakthrough might be possible in the next round of talks with Riyadh and thereafter with the rest of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until then, all the talk is likely to remain just that; yet another round of fruitless politicking that leads nowhere. Don&rsquo;t put a date in the diary just yet. A genuine solution is still a long way off.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165435.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'talks-with-iran-will-yield-little', '', '2021-11-29 11:27:15', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(176, 4, 13, 'France’s Exit from Sahel War Offers Russia an Opportunity to Move In', NULL, NULL, '<p>Another Western army is leaving a fragile, landlocked region. But whereas the United States has pulled its troops out of one country,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/biden-erdogan-afghanistan-strategy/\">Afghanistan</a>, France is walking away from five. To surprisingly little fanfare, France has announced it is ending Operation Barkhane, its almost decade-long military intervention in the Sahel. Having tried America&rsquo;s Iraq playbook to win its Sahel war, it is now using the Afghanistan playbook to walk away from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>France has had troops in the Sahel, a belt of countries stretching along the edge of the Sahara, for over eight years. What started as an attempt to stop Mali being overrun by jihadis has morphed into a military operation spread across five countries, with more than 5,000 French troops. Ostensibly, the French are there to stop militant groups fighting a long-running, low-level insurgency across the region, one that has claimed thousands of lives and displaced two million people. But in reality, French troops have functioned as the &ldquo;personal army&rdquo; of Sahel governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The intervention is unpopular, both in the region, where French involvement is resented as a colonial hangover, and at home, where French casualties have extracted a political cost. Emmanuel Macron himself seemed to understand that reality when he said in June that France could not &ldquo;substitute itself forever for the states of the region.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some ways, making the decision to leave was the easy part. France now faces the same dilemma the US did in Afghanistan: how to remove troops from the country without the swift collapse of the governments they had spent years guarding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>France originally tried to win the war by force, seeking to replicate the 2007 US &ldquo;surge&rdquo; strategy in Iraq. Last year, it sent an additional 600 troops to the region, hoping to clear a path that would allow local forces to take control. There were some bright spots &ndash; Al Qaeda&rsquo;s chief in North Africa was killed &ndash; but the price was bloody. Last year was the single worst for civilian casualties since France&rsquo;s entry in 2013; nearly 7,000 civilians were killed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, France is looking for a way out, and is eyeing America&rsquo;s Afghan strategy of getting allies to do most of the work in protecting the government from outside attacks. A new Takuba task force will replace Operation Barkhane; it will be made up of 600 troops, half of whom will come from European Union countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a risky strategy, both for the Sahel and for Paris. Macron hopes to remove the Sahel intervention as a source of criticism ahead of next year&rsquo;s French elections. But how a contingent of hundreds is meant to achieve what thousands of troops could not, has not been explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is, moreover, the public mood to consider. The largest non-French contingents in Takuba are Swedish, Estonian and Czech soldiers; all from countries that have little link to the Sahel and whose publics will be very sensitive to casualties. The Swedish parliament has only approved the deployment until the end of this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without French troops, the Sahel might resemble another Western war: this time, Libya, an invasion that ended with foreign influence flooding in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That already appears to be the case, with the familiar figure of Russia waiting in the wings to step in and protect Sahel governments from militants. The past year has seen two major events in the region &ndash; and in both cases, there are reports of Russian involvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first, in August last year, was the military overthrow of Mali&rsquo;s president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, mid-way through his second five-year term in office. The second was the sudden death of Chad&rsquo;s president, Idriss D&eacute;by, who had been in power for three decades. Chad is the headquarters of Operation Barkhane and Macron was the only Western head of state to attend his funeral &ndash; which was held even as the rebel soldiers who had carried out the attack that killed D&eacute;by were threatening to march on the capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taken together, the net result is that two long-time French allies are no longer in power, and two formerly stable governments are now in flux. Macron, who is sensitive to the criticism that France is more comfortable with strongmen leaders in Africa than with genuine democracy, is having to perform an unhappy balancing act, welcoming D&eacute;by&rsquo;s son to Paris in early July while insisting the military junta he leads must transition to civilian rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports of Russian involvement in both events are sketchy and could well be overstated. Britain&rsquo;s The Times newspaper reported the Chadian rebels that killed president D&eacute;by were trained in Libya by Russian mercenaries attached to the shadowy Wagner Group. Germany&rsquo;s public broadcaster, DW, suggested two of the architects of the Mali coup spent a year at a military college in Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is certain is that, quietly, Russia has expanded its relations in the region over the past four years, inking military cooperation deals with three Sahel countries. Russia&rsquo;s Wagner Group also operate in Libya and the Central African Republic, countries bordering Chad north and south.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia has already demonstrated the ability of its mercenaries to fight rebels and protect the government in the CAR. From the perspective of the CAR government, it has done so without lectures on democracy and without colonial baggage. (The civilian perspective is rather different: just last week, the Kremlin was forced to deny its military instructors in the country had killed civilians and looted homes.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When French troops finally leave, the Sahel governments, still fragile, and in Mali and Chad even more fragile than before, will still need foreign troops to protect their tenuous hold on power. How long before they look south to the CAR and seek the help of Moscow? As in Afghanistan, the exit of Western troops will just open the door for the Russians.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165500.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'frances-exit-from-sahel-war-offers-russia-an-opportunity-to-move-in', '', '2021-11-29 11:28:20', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(177, 4, 13, 'Will Israel’s New Government Revive Ties with Turkey?', NULL, NULL, '<p>With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/a-new-israeli-politics/\">Naftali Bennett</a>&nbsp;now prime minister, Israel&rsquo;s foreign policy direction has been under scrutiny. Eyes are locked on how politically divisive issues like West Bank settlements, peace with the Palestinians and religious-secular relations will be handled by the fragile eight-party coalition. Is a strategic foreign policy reorientation possible? (Coalition members certainly want this.) So far, however, little in the way of the new government&rsquo;s intentions are clear across a range of geographies and interests. Within such an atmosphere, the question of revitalized ties between Israel and Turkey has unsurprisingly emerged in recent weeks. (Only, don&rsquo;t bet on it.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel has tipped the balance against its isolation in the Eastern Mediterranean in recent years by striking a deal to form the Hellenic Alliance. This aligns Israel with Greece, Egypt, Cyprus, Italy, Jordan and Palestine &ndash; all members of the Cairo-based East Mediterranean Gas Forum. The UAE signed on in December as an observer, largely as a rebuke to Turkey&rsquo;s ambitions in the region; Ankara was never invited to join either the forum or the alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keen to steer out of its isolation, Ankara has made overtures separately to Egypt and the Palestinians in recent months, which included proposals to redraw conflicting maritime borders in the Eastern Mediterranean. Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh agreed in theory to this offer, seeing the outreach as an affirmation of Palestine&rsquo;s status and therefore of its rights. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time Turkey tried to sideline its adversaries through alternative deal-making. In 2019, Ankara signed a maritime agreement with Libya&rsquo;s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord, causing upset among other littoral countries that saw the move as an affront to their own maritime zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Israel&rsquo;s side, more of the same probably is on the cards as it seeks to build on recent gains, for example, with the Abraham Accords. The Accords, brokered by former US president Donald Trump, normalized relations between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. Israel&rsquo;s ambassador to Greece, Yossi Amrani, has said that bilateral relations would continue to grow and that a change in government would not deter plans for the EastMed gas pipeline project. Yair Lapid, who serves as Israel&rsquo;s foreign minister until he takes over as prime minister in two years&rsquo; time, visits the UAE on June 29 and 30 to inaugurate the country&rsquo;s embassy in Abu Dhabi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, for all that, and especially because the new government consists of ideologically opposed parties united only in their defiance against Benjamin Netanyahu, there is pressure for some measure of change away from Netanyahu-era policy, or at the very least from that of the past couple of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is for this reason that some have looked to a re-engagement with Turkey as low-hanging fruit. Relations between the two that were once the model for strategic cooperation in the Middle East and a lifeline for both countries, have had their ups and downs since diplomatic normalization in 2016. Yet ties in one form or another have existed since 1949; thus, it isn&rsquo;t impossible to imagine their revival from their current low. Restoring relations to ambassadorial level would be a start. The trouble is, Ankara&rsquo;s outreach to Gaza-based Palestinians works against a long-time demand by Israel for Turkey to limit its relations with Hamas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, Turkey is keen to revive its standing as a stakeholder on the Palestinian issue. The matter of settlements in the West Bank and the whittling down of the two-state solution rank high on Turkey&rsquo;s list of grievances. It has long prided itself on championing Palestinian rights internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inclusion of the Israeli-Arab Ra&rsquo;am party in the coalition government was interpreted as giving Turkey&rsquo;s ruling AKP party a reason to extend an olive branch to Israel. But earlier this month, Turkish foreign minister Mevl&uuml;t &Ccedil;avuşoğlu said stability between the two states depends on Israel stopping &ldquo;unlawful practices against the Palestinians.&rdquo; Echoing this line, political scholar Burhanettin Duran wrote in Turkey&rsquo;s Daily Sabah that while Bennett is not weighed down by Netanyahu&rsquo;s baggage, it is unlikely that he will stray from his predecessor&rsquo;s position on the status of Jerusalem or the West Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the future of Turkey-Israel ties need not be so bleak. According to Can Kasapoglu, an Istanbul-based war and security analyst, while Turkey will continue to pursue geopolitical competition with Iran and Russia that dates back to the days of empire, the same is not true vis-a-vis Israel. In an interview with Turkey&rsquo;s Şalom newspaper, he said there is nothing inevitable about a breakdown in relations between Turkey and Israel, adding that meeting reciprocal demands on each side is still possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even then, progress will be slow and hard. George N Tzogopoulos, a fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies in Israel, points out that both Bennett and Lapid were tough on Turkey in the past. He told me via email that &ldquo;Israel and Turkey disagree on many themes,&rdquo; but added that they &ldquo;have kept channels of communication open and they can still cooperate.&rdquo; According to Tzogopoulos, &ldquo;Israel is primarily interested in safeguarding its national security and therefore it will be keen on seeking common ground with Turkey.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last decade, Israel has cultivated new allies. Turkey, once seen as an indispensable interlocutor, is met with greater caution today. Indeed, many new friends of Israel are likely to urge against reinvigorating relations with Turkey. So while Bennett may be keen to show some foreign policy independence from Netanyahu, Israel&rsquo;s larger interests and Turkey&rsquo;s desire for leadership in Palestine clash with the goal of getting the two largest Middle East powers on the Eastern Mediterranean to form closer ties. The possibility is there, but the momentum to take a leap of faith is not.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165569.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'will-israels-new-government-revive-ties-with-turkey', '', '2021-11-29 11:29:29', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(178, 4, 13, 'An Emerging Economic Model in the Middle East Transforms the Pursuit of Peace', NULL, NULL, '<p>For Gulf nations, changing global energy demand means the need to diversify their economies is topmost in mind. Thus, when Crown Prince Sheikh Meshal Al-Ahmad of Kuwait met his counterpart from Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in Riyadh on June 1, it is likely the two discussed each other&rsquo;s plans to reduce their nations&rsquo; dependence on oil. Indeed, after the meeting between the two, Kuwait&rsquo;s ambassador to Riyadh noted that Gulf countries realize that oil is a resource that is bound to run out &mdash; or one might add, become less valuable as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/shortages-amid-abundance/\">sustainability</a>&nbsp;becomes the global norm &mdash; and that the region must get ready to live without it. He might have added that this is an existential imperative that will transform the region in more than just economic terms. Think peace, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, some ambitious plans for the post-oil era already are in place. Part of Kuwait&rsquo;s 2035 Project includes a new free-trade hub at the northern end of the Gulf, evocatively named Silk City to recall the region&rsquo;s past as a vital staging post on the fabled Silk Road. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has its Vision 2030, designed to transform the northwest of the country into a vast trade and tourism hub that includes an entire new city named Neom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both plans, while not identical to the transformation already on track in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, surely take inspiration from the Emirati cities. The UAE&rsquo;s non-oil exports have been growing steadily over the past decade. In 2019, UAE exports stood at nearly $400 billion, of which $82 billion were from activity not related to the energy market. In the first nine months of 2020 alone, the UAE&rsquo;s non-oil exports had grown to $125 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And here&rsquo;s the interesting thing. The signing of the Abraham Accords with Israel last year is estimated to have produced a $44-billion surge in exports for the UAE (it will be instructive to see the UAE&rsquo;s full-year export data). The argument for peace as the best and most essential enabler of commerce could not be clearer; overcoming the divisions between the two countries has opened the door to vast new possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a historical precedent, and particularly one related to the Arab world, there are few more pertinent examples than the Baghdad of a thousand years ago. When the city was founded in 762, it was known as the City of Peace. Abul-Abbas Al-Yaaqoubi, a 9th century Abbasid geographer, wrote of how Baghdad&rsquo;s location at the confluence of two great rivers brought in merchandise from all parts of the then known world. It was &ldquo;inhabited by peoples from all countries, far and near&rdquo; who, he claimed, preferred the city to their homelands. It was this diversity that allowed Baghdad to thrive and earned Al-Yaaqoubi&rsquo;s description of it as &ldquo;a great city the likes of which there is none in the east and west, in its vastness and architecture.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His description could very well be applied to Emirati cities today. Abu Dhabi and Dubai in particular have become global trade hubs and metropolises where millions of migrants live and work. Like 9th century Baghdad, Abu Dhabi and Dubai deserve the sobriquet &ldquo;Cities of Peace.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Islamic imperial rulers, such as the Ottomans of Turkey, understood the importance of peace in enabling commerce. In the early years of his presidency, so did Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Through his policy of &ldquo;zero problems with neighbors,&rdquo; the Turkish economy enjoyed robust growth. But when Erdogan began losing support at home, he used foreign policy as a distraction. &ldquo;Zero problems&rdquo; became &ldquo;problems with everyone&rdquo; and the economy entered what continues to be a steep decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine, then, the benefits that would accrue were this region no longer to be the cauldron of conflict that it has been for the past hundred years. What grand opportunities would open up not just for the Gulf nations, but also those without the blessing of oil? The greatest impediment to such a situation, alas, lies firstly with mischief makers in Tehran, who have yet to realize the waning usefulness of their hydrocarbon stock but are in fact funding conflict with rent from oil. And then there are those for whom nurturing their domestic enmity through civil war is the ontological essence of their regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gulf states, from Saudi Arabia to Kuwait to the UAE, demonstrate that a new economic model &mdash; one replicable by all, unlike the one based on qualifications to Opec membership &mdash; is in place. What it needs to thrive is a dedication to a new paradigm for economic momentum in the Middle East. That would be peace. Indeed, if one were to carefully parse all the diplomatic initiatives in the Gulf in recent years, one would conclude that they are predicated on the pursuit of peace as the engine of economic growth. (Of course, one should not be so naive as to expect peace to come from singing Kumbaya around the campfire; sometimes, to eventually get peace, you must threaten to, or even actually, fight for it.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arab pride in their trading capabilities through the ages is well-justified. Commerce is in their DNA. It was there at the birth of Islam. Contrary to what Islamists would have us believe, the Prophet Mohammed was not a warrior obsessed with conflict; he was, in fact, from a merchant tribe, and he married the widow of a merchant and managed her business affairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long before oil, Arabs grew prosperous on their ability to trade with anyone and everyone. With more peace, it could happen again throughout the Middle East. It would redefine the region to the world.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165637.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'an-emerging-economic-model-in-the-middle-east-transforms-the-pursuit-of-peace', '', '2021-11-29 11:30:37', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

It is tempting people to chart new life paths as they glimpse what they believe to be a post-pandemic future. It&rsquo;s an illusion. The failure of the rich world to help vaccinate developing countries in a manner that matches the West, threatens the very success the rich believe to be at hand. Large swaths of the Global South, including most of Africa, is now in the grip of a new wave of Covid-19 infections. It&rsquo;s foolish of the West to think it can regain normality when new virus variants will continue to emerge because not enough people around the globe are being vaccinated. A map of well-vaccinated and under-vaccinated nations might draw comparisons to atlases of the early 20th&nbsp;century showing colonial capital countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa, the continent&rsquo;s most industrialized country, is a prime example of the worrying trend underfoot. With the onset of winter in the southern hemisphere and a dismal vaccination rate, it is currently gripped by its third wave of infection, one that is proving to be the most deadly yet. Hospitals in Johannesburg are running out of beds and oxygen as the country battles the Delta variant. There is talk of renewed hard-lockdowns, but no clear plan to fight infections other than to wait out this wave and hope for more vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will be a long wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reason is the failure of the Covax vaccine procurement program to achieve its initial goals. Launched a year ago, Covax was heralded as an &ldquo;unparalleled and ambitious&rdquo; effort to create a global procurement mechanism to supply Covid-19 vaccines to all countries. Ninety-two of the world&rsquo;s poorest and middle-income countries were supposed to receive vaccines at no cost. High-income nations would pay for their vaccines through Covax. Together, the two arms of the mechanism were meant to see an orderly roll out of vaccines throughout the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, rich nations began to sign deals directly with vaccine makers even before the jabs were ready. And because governments couldn&rsquo;t be sure which would work, they bought from multiple pharmaceutical companies, reserving more doses than they needed. Meanwhile, Covax began to make concessions to rich countries, letting them choose which vaccine they would receive under the program, and then later letting them purchase enough vaccines for up to 50 percent of their population. Poorer countries, however, would still only get enough for up to 20 percent of their population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the above has been the mechanism through which rich nations have hoarded most of the available doses. Ten countries have administered 75 percent of all the Covid vaccines produced so far. It is this that has allowed the West to glimpse the possibility of normality &ndash; most often celebrated in social media as the ability to visit a pub or bar for a pint or two; to go on holidays, sometimes abroad; to visit sport arenas and fitness facilities. Meanwhile, in India, South Africa, the Philippines and so on, scenes of actual dystopia persist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The failure of Covax can&rsquo;t be explained away by greed alone. An article in the medical journal, The Lancet, explains that &ldquo;global health experts point to [Covax&rsquo;s] failure to recognize supply constraints as a major obstacle to global vaccination and emphasize diversifying and scaling up manufacturing from the beginning. This lack of recognition was a serious flaw in the Covax design.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Covax much compromised, there are new efforts afoot to supply emerging markets with vaccines. France, commendably so, and the World Health Organization announced on June 22 that they would help South Africa set up a production facility for Covid-19 vaccines. South Africa&rsquo;s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that Africa now understood that vaccines would &ldquo;never come&rdquo; from elsewhere in time to save lives. Thus, his country and the continent needed to start producing its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He may be right. However, the initiative is going to be too late as a remedy for the current wave of infections sweeping the continent, and maybe even for this pandemic as a whole. Moreover, while South Africa may have the soft and hard infrastructure to build a vaccine facility, most emerging countries don&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This, in fact, speaks to a persistence of post-colonial trade protocols that have outlasted formal empires. Seven decades since the beginning of the end of European empires in Africa, the modus operandi remains to buy commodities cheaply from Africa and other ex-colonies and then ship them back as finished products. At best, the Global North&rsquo;s multinationals might deign to build a factory in emerging economies to take advantage of cheap, low-skill labor. But there has been no rush to transfer enough technology that might have created an indigenous pharmaceutical company able to do high-level R&amp;D in Africa. It is particularly precious of rich nations to say that they are protecting intellectual property, when they feel no compunction about their mining companies, for example, carting off a poor country&rsquo;s natural resources, ripped out of the ground in a devastating rape of the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understandably then, many Western countries, and indeed many of their citizens, have little problem disregarding the health and well-being of &ldquo;the rest.&rdquo; Fair weather friends may have talked up the idea of us all being in one world, like an unending refrain from the Live Aid anthem. But when the chips are down, it&rsquo;s another story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, they do this at their very own peril. Faced with a global pandemic that doesn&rsquo;t recognize borders, no one is safe until everyone is safe. The West &ndash; its governments and its peoples &ndash; must recognize that the virus raging in emerging countries threatens the global community and threatens them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>International efforts such as Covax spectacularly failed because wealthier nations focused on themselves instead of a global fight. The reality is that the virus will bite back hard through variants currently incubating in countries left with no vaccines. In the absence of sound multilateral protocols, the fight against Covid-19 is bound to go on. In Brooklyn and in London they may think they&rsquo;ve glimpsed a future free of the virus. But unless that vision becomes manifest in Mumbai, Dakar and Cape Town, too, it&rsquo;s a mirage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Covid-19 is caused by a virus. But our inability to adequately and properly confront it comes from a legacy of imperial privilege.

(180, 4, 15, 'Why Is Nato Member Turkey Eyeing Up a Partnership with Russia?', NULL, NULL, '<p>Historically, Russia and Turkey have always been rivals, geopolitically speaking. In recent times they have, however, managed to forge a working partnership in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/syrian-kurds-russia-turkey/\">Syria</a>, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, but it is one that depends heavily on their current relations with what is still the world&rsquo;s biggest power &ndash; the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ankara and Washington are allies in Nato but they have been at odds over some big issues, such as Turkey&rsquo;s purchase of the Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missile system &ndash; a move that resulted in the US imposing sanctions last year. Then there are significant differences on regional policy &ndash; namely, America&rsquo;s support for the Kurdish-led People&rsquo;s Protection Units in Syria and Washington&rsquo;s refusal to extradite Fethullah Gulen, the Turkish cleric who has been living in Pennsylvania since the late 1990s but is regarded by the Turkish government as a dangerous dissident who incited the 2016 attempted coup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Ankara&rsquo;s point of view, that all makes Russia a better bet than the US as a strategic partner &ndash; and the Turkish people seem to agree. A recent survey revealed that nearly 79 percent of respondents would prefer that Turkey partners with Russia rather than the United States. When asked, &ldquo;Do you think Turkey should cooperate with the US while conducting its foreign policy?&rdquo; 73 percent responded, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Kremlin&rsquo;s perspective, a rupture in US-Turkish relations could lead to the destruction of the old world order and undermine the unity of the West. Not so long ago, Turkey used its power of veto to water down an official condemnation by Nato of the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko. Turkish officials reportedly insisted that Nato should not collectively oppose Belarus or demand the release of political prisoners. Unless Ankara changes tack, it will be very difficult for Nato to take a united position on Belarus, Russia&rsquo;s only ally in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But won&rsquo;t Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who once called Vladimir Putin &ldquo;dear friend,&rdquo; expect something in return? And what might that be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April, Russia suspended flights to Turkish airports, allegedly because of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Turkey. The reality is a different story; this was Moscow putting pressure on Ankara over another matter altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Erdogan was hosting the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Istanbul, along with their respective defense chiefs to discuss strengthening their &ldquo;strategic partnership.&rdquo; It is no secret that Ukraine is interested in purchasing Turkish-made Bayraktar drones that played such a crucial role during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia last autumn, and wants to deploy them in its ongoing struggle against pro-Russian forces in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moscow denies that the cancellation of flights and the warming relations between Ankara and Kiev are in any way connected. But the Kremlin has a track record of finding imaginative ways to show its displeasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, Turkey downed a Russian fighter jet in Syria. Russia retaliated by banning all tomato imports from Turkey. At the time, some regarded Moscow&rsquo;s response as too feeble. But not only did the move badly affect Turkish exporters (Russia was Turkey&rsquo;s biggest export market for tomatoes), it actually strengthened domestic production in Russia as the government invested in greenhouse projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erdogan&rsquo;s independence of mind and method in foreign policy may have raised Turkey&rsquo;s global status, but the economy remains his weak spot. According to Turkish tourism operators, Russia&rsquo;s flight ban is likely to cost the country around $500 million in lost business &ndash; a situation serious enough to warrant inviting a Russian health delegation to visit Turkey to review the safety measures in place at Turkish resorts, and for Ankara to keep petitioning Moscow to reconsider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with the tomato ban, which lasted two years, the issue will no doubt be resolved sooner or later, and Russia and Turkey will resume cooperation, primarily in the field of energy. Russia is heavily involved in building the Akkuyu nuclear power plant in Turkey&rsquo;s Mersin province and has completed construction of the TurkStream natural gas pipeline. The recent discovery of new natural gas deposits in the Black Sea means that Ankara could become less dependent on Russia for energy eventually, but in the meantime the Akkuyu project and the S-400 missile system are likely to ensure a long-term Russian presence in Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That does not mean Russia and Turkey are, or ever will be, friends, however. They may agree on ceasefires and control their proxies on the ground in Syria and Libya, but their goals are diametrically opposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judging by his current actions, Erdogan intends to persist with ensuring that Turkey is an influential player in the region&rsquo;s energy-rich territories. Any &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; between Moscow and Ankara will consist of ramping up any local tensions, for which there is ample potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Eastern Mediterranean, the dispute over gas exploration could escalate into conflict. In Libya, Turkey&rsquo;s signing of a controversial maritime boundary treaty with the UN-backed Government of National Accord is a blatant move to secure a share of the country&rsquo;s oil and gas reserves. Even the potential for more upheaval in the Middle East and Central Asia cannot be discounted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is certain is that any opportunity for more muscle-flexing by Russia and Turkey means that new conflicts, wars and territorial claims are inevitable.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165849.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'why-is-nato-member-turkey-eyeing-up-a-partnership-with-russia', '', '2021-11-29 11:34:09', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(181, 4, 15, 'Iraq’s Prime Minister Has Won the Most Fragile of Victories Against Shia Militias', NULL, NULL, '<p>The last time Iraq&rsquo;s prime minister tried to arrest members of the powerful Iran-backed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/time-for-iraqs-militias-to-lay-down-arms/\">militias</a>, they were out of custody within a week. This time, Mustafa Al-Kadhimi held on to one of their own for twice as long, as near a victory as can be imagined, given the fragility of the Iraqi state. Two events over three days in May have set the stage for a summer of confrontation as Iraq heads into a new election in October. On one side, the powerful Shia militias that defeated ISIS in Mosul. On the other, long-running popular protests that have already toppled one prime minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the middle is Al-Kadhimi, in office for a year and as liable to be blamed for any violence that comes from confronting the militias as for failing to deal with the demands of the protesters. But Al-Kadhimi&rsquo;s dilemma is not merely a political balancing act, weighing one group against the other. It is existential, because what the protestors are really calling for is the primacy of state power over the militias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the stakes so high, Al-Kadhimi&rsquo;s brief victory over the militias looks paltry, a gesture that hardly rises to the political moment. A premiership that is judged a success because a paramilitary leader has been held for a matter of days is surely a premiership in name only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The confrontation began after Iraqi security forces arrested Qassem Muslih, the head of the Popular Mobilization Forces division in Anbar. The PMF are an umbrella group of some 40 militias, many of them backed by Iran.&nbsp;The next day, the PMF mobilized a show of force on the streets of Baghdad, surrounding the headquarters of the prime minister. A tense stand-off eventually ended with the PMF dispersing. But a message had been sent. The militias would not tolerate one of their own being arrested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, such a show of force would have been enough to make the government back down and release Muslih. A year previously, soon after Al-Kadhimi took office, he arrested 14 members of Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia. The same thing happened: armed militias took to the streets of Baghdad and the men were released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time Al-Kadhimi held firm. Although Muslih was eventually released on June 9, the prime minister may now feel sufficiently empowered by the protest movement to finally break the power of the militias, or keeping Muslih in custody was simply a way of sending a message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In truth, Al-Kadhimi&rsquo;s actions seem opaque and that opacity is deliberate. He has not, for example, yet said whether he will stand for election in October. That uncertainty means groups like the PMF and their supporters within Iraq&rsquo;s parliament are reluctant to move against him too forcefully, lest they waste their political capital on someone who is on his way out. The same is true of the protesters, who will not want to call openly for Al-Kadhimi to go &ndash; only for him to go anyway in a matter of months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That opacity gives him a certain ability to navigate all the shades of gray of Iraq&rsquo;s politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One interpretation of this standoff with the militias is that Al-Kadhimi knew he could not win an outright clash with the PMF, but hoped to hold Muslih for long enough to establish that he would not be bullied by them. That would give him some credibility with voters and even the protesters, who may believe he is sincere in wanting to seek out those who attack activists. It may even give him a boost as the country enters a summer of protests and perhaps set him up as a law-and-order candidate in the autumn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that seems an overly cynical interpretation, it is worth recalling that after his year in office, Al-Kadhimi has yet to make a definitive break with the militias or their patrons in Iran. The investigation he promised into the disappearance of protesters kidnapped by armed men has yet to start work. He has neither said he wants American troops to leave Iraq nor that he wants Iranian influence to cease. He has been as happy to visit Tehran as Riyadh and Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some will see in that the same cautious balancing of forces as with his balancing of protesters and the militias. But there is a point at which balance becomes inertia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Al-Kadhimi may have won a small victory against the militias, but it is a most fragile one, likely to be overturned at any moment. The paramilitary leader hasn&rsquo;t been charged so far and has yet to see the inside of a courtroom. If he does, the response from the PMF militias could be fierce, the kind of clash a cautious Al-Kadhimi will want to defer until after the election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But tiptoeing along a tightrope is only an option if you have a plan for getting to the other side. Al-Kadhimi&rsquo;s caution is helping no one: not the families who want answers about the loss of their sons and daughters and not ordinary Iraqis who need to live in a country where the writ of the state still runs.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638165950.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'iraqs-prime-minister-has-won-the-most-fragile-of-victories-against-shia-militias', '', '2021-11-29 11:35:50', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(182, 4, 15, 'The Covid-19 Pandemic Has Put Turkey on Suicide Watch', NULL, NULL, '<p>On April 29, with no prior warning, Turkey went into full lockdown for three weeks. Within 24 hours, four people committed suicide, all of them for the same reason: despair over their financial future. In all, 129 people took their own lives in April. Yet the psychological impact of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/turkey-open-borders/\">Covid-related</a>&nbsp;hardship and lack of financial assistance are subjects that the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his government have not sufficiently addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real suicide tally may well be higher, as the numbers are only from cases reported in the press. Opposition politician Gamze Taşcıer has called on the government to take action, describing the increase in suicides as &ldquo;a pandemic in itself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A rising suicide rate is, unfortunately, nothing new in Turkey. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, suicides have increased by 89 percent in the last 20 years. A flagging economy, the instability of the Turkish lira, double-digit inflation, the rising cost of basic goods and the lack of steady employment have all pushed many people close to the edge. Then, Covid-19 tipped them over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than a year into the pandemic, the International Monetary Fund ranks Turkey alongside Albania and Mexico as countries that have provided the least financial assistance to their citizens. This is confirmed by a report published in February by the Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey, which states that the government had spent only the equivalent of 1.1 percent of GDP on health and financial aid packages combined. The government&rsquo;s own statistics show that 250,000 people registered as unemployed in February alone, while millions more have no regular income. That&rsquo;s cause for a lot of stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erdogan has said that around 3.7 million citizens who have been forced to cut their working hours have applied for short-term financial assistance to top up reduced salaries, and another million have received unemployment benefits during the pandemic. But the available financial aid rarely goes to those who most need it. According to Dr Vedat Bulut, secretary-general of the Turkish Medical Association, &ldquo;ten percent went to the poor while 90 percent went to business owners.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hardest hit are small businesses, the self-employed and casual workers &ndash; none of whom qualify for government aid packages. The World Bank&rsquo;s economic monitor report on Turkey states that 30 percent of the country&rsquo;s working population is made up of casual or informal labor. Official figures from the Turkish Tradesmen and Craftsmen Registry Gazette show that 273 small businesses went bankrupt every day in 2020. That&rsquo;s cause for more stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manual laborers and musicians may not have much in common. But they share the unfortunate fate of having been almost completely neglected during the pandemic. It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss entertainment as frivolous and not a &ldquo;key&rdquo; part of the economy, but that would be wrong. The music industry employs more than a million people in Turkey, none of whom has received any financial support from the government, neither in short-term assistance nor in unemployment benefit. As a consequence, the rock star Gaye Su Akyol claimed in a tweet that 105 musicians have committed suicide during the pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vice-chair of the opposition Republican People&rsquo;s Party, Gamze Akkuş İlgezdi, has claimed that withholding financial support from artists was &ldquo;unconstitutional&rdquo; and suggested that the culture and tourism ministry should remove the world &ldquo;culture&rdquo; from its title &ldquo;if it is not going to help those in need.&rdquo; Her proposal to use the tax the government collects on products such as DVDs and CDs to fund artists in need has also been rejected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With poor conditions, low wages and long working hours, manual laborers were already suffering even before Covid-19 arrived in Turkey. ISIG, the body that monitors health and safety in the workplace, reports a five-fold increase in suicides in the last six years. The Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions predicts many more after the ban on layoffs is lifted in four months&rsquo; time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Most of these people cannot make ends meet. Everyone is in debt. They are using up what is left of their savings. These are desperate times,&rdquo; said the confederation&rsquo;s Nebile Irmak &Ccedil;etin, in an interview with the newspaper, Independent Turkey, while Dr Doğan K&ouml;kdemir, professor of psychology at Başkent University, has warned of a &ldquo;suicide contagion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, on May 17, the president appeared finally to have acknowledged the depth of the despair afflicting his country. He announced a $555 million fund to disperse one-time payments of 3,000 Turkish lira ($356) to those worst-affected by the pandemic, including taxi drivers, restaurant workers and musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while the gesture is welcome, the government is still missing the point. A one-off handout may help people pay their bills and feed themselves for a while, but it will not ease the mental strain of worrying about the long-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The economic loss caused by the pandemic is obvious and calculable. One can also define and recognize the loss of social interaction. But the impact on mental health is less quantifiable and may not be felt for months or even years to come. For the government to ignore it now is not only to be dismissive of people&rsquo;s current suffering, it is storing up trouble for the future.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166010.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'the-covid-19-pandemic-has-put-turkey-on-suicide-watch', '', '2021-11-29 11:36:50', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(183, 4, 15, 'Diplomacy Is Back in the Middle East, With or Without the US', NULL, NULL, '<p>One of the tenets of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/biden-change-in-style-not-substance-with-china-policy/\">Biden administration</a>&nbsp;is the return to diplomacy, as part of how the US positions itself after the &ldquo;forever wars&rdquo; in Iraq and Afghanistan. Returning to the Paris agreement on climate, reopening negotiations on US participation in the Iran nuclear agreement and visiting allies to show respect for them and the value of alliances are all part of the plan. It&rsquo;s also about restoring confidence and a central role for the state department &ndash; filling long-vacant senior positions and putting career diplomats in many of the key policy jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of diplomacy going on in key regions in which the US is not the key player, or even involved. Is that a sign of the contraction of American power? Other countries may be taking up the slack where they see a vacuum of leadership, or they may take the initiative, knowing that their interests in a particular conflict are quite different from America&rsquo;s. Will the Biden administration try to reverse the trend with its &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Back&rdquo; message?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take the most recent case, the diplomacy to achieve a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas over Gaza. The Egyptians, according to most accounts, coordinated with Hamas and Israel. President Joe Biden acknowledged that his calls to Israeli prime minister Netanyahu were in support of Egyptian efforts, not the primary diplomatic initiative. He thanked the Egyptian president for his successful diplomacy in a call on May 25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of comparable consequence for the region is the dialogue between the Saudis and Iranians brokered by Iraq. While the Iraqi government is playing it down, it appears that the good offices of Iraqi intelligence, rather than the foreign ministry, may deserve the credit. Still, such a channel could pave the way for a more-open diplomatic process. It&rsquo;s quite a turnabout, considering that Iraq was such a wounded, weak party for years after the US invasion of 2003. Now, it is rebounding and finding that its unique ties to Iran provide it some clout and credibility in facilitating a de-escalation of tension between Riyadh and Tehran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the long saga of Syria&rsquo;s civil war, Turkey has positioned itself as a prominent diplomatic player, mostly related to its border and its abiding security obsession with preventing Kurdish ascendence as an independent political actor. Often, Turkey&rsquo;s efforts have been at odds with US interests in the region, and sometimes it has aligned itself as the junior partner of Moscow. In fact, when Turkey joined the Astana process trying to negotiate a settlement of Syria, it was noted in Washington that a Nato ally was working with Moscow and Tehran. This seemingly worked at cross purposes to the process the UN and US had worked for years to implement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another unexpected sign of smaller powers playing more weighty diplomatic roles is Eritrea&rsquo;s efforts to smooth tensions between Sudan and Ethiopia. Over decades, Eritrea had been the victim of the more powerful Ethiopia&rsquo;s hegemonic designs, but such dynamics have changed, due to Ethiopia&rsquo;s need for Eritrean support in its struggle against the powerful Tigrean minority. Eritrea seized the opportunity to demonstrate its skill at balancing its stronger neighbors and proving it can be a wily sovereign player in regional relations. This does not mean that Eritrea will embody high ideals of statesmanship, but it does demonstrate that diplomacy is an attribute of national power and influence quite separate from military force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In each of these cases, the US appears to be observing and supporting, not taking the lead. The new cautious realism of the US national security enterprise may be comfortable with regional states taking the lead on conflict resolution within their regions. In theory, that has long been desirable, embedded in many presidential speeches about regional responsibility. President Barack Obama certainly believed that solutions to regional problems would be more durable and legitimate if led by the people most directly affected. In practice, however, many countries with competent diplomatic personnel still prefer to wait for a sign of American intentions, or believe that large summits and regional conferences simply cannot happen without US organizational skill and political clout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And one should not assume that these middle powers (Eritrea is an outlier) are new to the diplomacy business. To the contrary, Egypt, Turkey and Iran have great histories and legacies as skilled diplomats and power brokers, whether at the UN, where Egypt has long gone head to head with the US over a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East, for example, or in more immediate geography, as when Turkey&rsquo;s Turgut Ozal worked tirelessly behind the scenes during the Iran-Iraq War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But aligning these stories with the trajectory of US influence and with the desire of successive US presidents to reduce America&rsquo;s exposure in the Middle East suggests that a new pattern may be emerging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People in the Gulf explain that the receptivity of Gulf Arabs to indirect talks with Iran is a preemptive move to protect Gulf interests, should the US return to the Iran nuclear deal. Rather than sit passively and complain that the US has not given sufficient attention to their interests, as was the case in 2015, this time the regional players are taking more responsibility for defining and defending their interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who embrace the &ldquo;restraint&rdquo; school of international relations, positing that an end of US hegemony in the Middle East is good for regional peace and security, these trends are very positive and signal a maturing of the politics of the region. If the US steps aside and is not setting the agenda, perhaps the parties will be more inclined to make compromises and find a more durable modus vivendi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others will be less comfortable, fearing new instability as less experienced players take the helm. The role of the Saudi crown prince in the Yemen war is a case in point. They also don&rsquo;t really believe the US will, in fact, leave the region. When they look at other great powers that may want to fill the vacuum of the US departure, they will decide that the status quo and reliance on the US for security and diplomacy, may be better than the alternatives. They will, however, have to make the case to Washington, already set on shifting its focus to the competition with China.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166078.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'diplomacy-is-back-in-the-middle-east-with-or-without-the-us', '', '2021-11-29 11:37:58', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Hubristically named after one of his domestic campaign slogans, &ldquo;Build Back Better for the World,&rdquo; or B3W, aims to be an alternative multilateral funding program to the BRI for developing countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideologically, the B3W rests on the rather facile assumption that the world today is divided between democracies and autocracies, and B3W will somehow &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; countries from their drift toward authoritarian China. This bifurcation of the world into two opposing camps will make America&rsquo;s European allies deeply uncomfortable, as it carries echoes of the Cold War. This notion elides the fact that due to democratic backsliding in the world today, there are various countries (e.g., Hungary, India, Turkey, Ethiopia) nominally allied to America, but which straddle the divide between democracy and autocracy. Furthermore, B3W is riddled with far too many internal inconsistencies and rests on America, Europe and Japan moving in tandem with regard to their China policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no uniform China policy within the European Union. Germany, for example, continues to view China as a critical market for its high-tech manufacturing products and automobiles. It will not want to be seen to be too enthusiastic in its support of B3W lest it antagonizes Beijing. The EU, despite American pressure, recently signed an investment deal with China. On the issue of freeing global supply chains from using forced labor (a reference to China&rsquo;s treatment of Uyghurs), there has even been pushback from American corporations. How does B3W plan to ensure global supply chains are free of products manufactured in Israel&rsquo;s illegal settler colonies in the occupied West Bank?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also remains to be seen how B3W will be funded, beyond vague assertions by American diplomats that the program will incorporate existing multinational funding programs. Moreover, B3W funding will be attached to conditions regarding human rights, climate change, corruption and the rule of law. This raises the question on why developing countries will choose to work with a patchwork of funding initiatives wedded to intrusive conditionalities rather than continue to seek China&rsquo;s simplified and no-strings-attached BRI funding. How does America plan to marshal its private-sector firms and banks to support B3W? Currently, the political atmosphere in the country remains hostile to large firms and banks, with Biden himself planning to finance his domestic Build Back Better program by raising taxes on big business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent America-led initiative to institute a global minimum tax on multinationals reduces their competitiveness against China&rsquo;s state-backed companies. Exactly how do American private-sector companies expect to maintain their competitiveness as part of a B3W package deal to developing countries? Moreover, how does America plan to offer attractive technologies to developing countries that choose B3W over BRI? Republicans in America remain allergic to industrial policy that seeks to divert public-sector funding toward research and development in strategic sectors. This has allowed China to steal a march over America over 5G technology, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That B3W is named after one of Biden&rsquo;s domestic initiatives is a well-worn sign of America&rsquo;s imperial pretensions. It assumes that what is good for America ought to be a model for the rest of the world. Yet even in this endeavor, America falls short. The US congress, which holds the purse strings for any government initiative, has yet to approve Biden&rsquo;s domestic spending initiatives under the Build Back Better program. Large parts of it may eventually have to be sacrificed to achieve bipartisan consensus in America&rsquo;s dysfunctional polity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even as America seeks to use B3W to promote free trade and more robust global supply chains, Washington is silent about re-joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. This multilateral free-trade agreement includes America&rsquo;s allies but faces strong opposition from both Republicans and Democrats. The B3W&rsquo;s planned incorporation of climate change and green goals is likely to run into opposition even from among America&rsquo;s allies. For example, there were howls of protest from across the Canadian political spectrum when the Biden administration recently canceled the Keystone XL pipeline project which was meant to transport oil from Canada to the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden wants to recast America as a model state, in the hope that this can increase the attractiveness of B3W. Yet, the White House has remained silent on B3W incorporating the movement of labor in addition to the movement of capital, goods and services. The Biden administration has yet to announce immigration reform. The world witnessed this recently when vice president Kamala Harris, herself the daughter of immigrants, told Central Americans: &ldquo;Do not come to the US.&rdquo; The world would rather sign up to BRI projects, which are based on hard-nosed realpolitik, than America&rsquo;s B3W, based on woolly feel-good values, to which America is very obviously only paying lip service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B3W found a vague single-line mention in the communique issued at the end of the G7 summit. This is perhaps a sign that the rest of the G7 members recognized it for what it was &ndash; verbal gimmickry aimed at a domestic audience by a newly elected president desperate for a foreign-policy victory.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166157.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'bidens-b3w-proposal-at-g7-wont-be-a-serious-threat-to-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative', '', '2021-11-29 11:39:17', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

There is no question that East Asia and China have become a priority for the administration, as evidenced by the persistent citing of the challenges awaiting America and by the formulation of new policies. The Middle East, where the US has expended trillions of dollars over decades, however, is not about to go away. The Israel-Hamas conflict may have reminded all of the volatility of the region, but this is not all. There are important structural reasons &ndash; some old, many new &ndash; that will keep Washington fully engaged in this part of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, over the years of US engagement, numerous commitments were made to a variety of states. The US has always had a hard time distancing itself from its promises as long as the other party has not gravely breached its part of a bargain. Above all, of course, are the security commitments Washington has made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cold War may be long over, but the hazards have not disappeared. There are a number of old and new revisionist powers prowling the region willing to challenge the US, which they perceive as tired and perhaps even weakened, and attempt to achieve their hegemonic ambitions. These notable powers are Russia, Iran, Turkey and, increasingly, China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Russians are not new to the region, of course. What is different about Russia is that while the Soviets always perceived &ndash; or at least rationalized &ndash; their behavior through an ideological prism, the new Russia is very much a Putin assembly and as such reflects its leader&rsquo;s preferences and ambitions. Vladimir Putin fancies himself running a superpower &ndash; yes, Russia does have a huge military and nuclear weapons &ndash; who should therefore be taken seriously. The reality is very different: Putin runs an economy that relies on oil and gas production and arms exports. It has little to contribute to global welfare. Russia&rsquo;s 2020 GDP was $1.5 trillion &ndash; just over five times Apple&rsquo;s 2020 sales of $275 billion (Apple&rsquo;s market capitalization is about $2.1 trillion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Putin&rsquo;s Russia engages in two types of activity: defending its allies, such as Bashar Al-Assad&rsquo;s Syria, or expending efforts to undermine American influence. It&rsquo;s a way of saying, &ldquo;I am important, pay attention to me.&rdquo; From cyberattacks to supporting regimes Washington either has targeted or deemed adversarial, to backing groups likely to undermine US interests, there does not seem to be a coherent Russian strategy other than maximizing its arms sales. Moscow does claim to support the status quo against Washington&rsquo;s machinations &ndash; it may have a point here in view of America&rsquo;s recent militarization of its foreign policy, especially in the Middle East &ndash; but the order it supports almost always portends an alliance with odious entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran is the quintessential revisionist power; its regime is still the by-product of the 1979 Revolution and its goals have not changed much since. It seeks to impose its vision on the region writ large. Iran&rsquo;s actions are both defensive and offensive in nature. In Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen and Syria, to name just a few, Tehran has founded, nurtured and funded violent militias. Not only are its actions unlikely to change, but they will force the US to remain continuously on its toes. This is likely to be the case regardless of the outcome of the nuclear negotiations and the future of the JCPOA. Were Washington to abandon its Iraqi allies, for instance, the likelihood of regime change in Baghdad would become a real possibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkey is a brand-new revisionist power. Traditionally a US Nato ally, Ankara has historically, despite its occasional differences with Washington, supported the status quo in the region or at least refrained from actions deleterious to America&rsquo;s interests. This has radically changed under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who views himself as the leader of the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erdogan, almost from the beginning of his rule 19 years ago, intends to make Turkey &ndash; and by default himself &ndash; a consequential global power. Through diplomacy and the smart use of Turkey&rsquo;s cultural advantages, he accomplished much initially. However, in part because of his impatience that resulted in increasingly aggressive measures ranging from the Eastern Mediterranean to Libya to Syria to supporting groups like the Muslim Brotherhood against established regimes, he has alienated many in the region. The turn to unabashed authoritarianism at home has not helped matters either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkey&rsquo;s Nato alliance commitments notwithstanding, Erdogan now sees himself as a challenger to the US in the Middle East. Anti-Americanism in Turkey encouraged by him, his party and the mostly regime-dominated press, has reached deafening levels. He has also shocked both the US and Nato by purchasing Russian-made S-400 anti-aircraft missiles that threaten the alliance&rsquo;s 5th generation F-35 fighter jet. His foreign policy increasingly is militarized and he has not refrained from deploying Turkey&rsquo;s prowess to gain support and a foothold not just in the Middle East, but also in Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apprehension about Erdogan&rsquo;s intentions is one reason why Gulf countries and Israel have established relations with each other, and new political-economic organizations linking Greece, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt have come into existence. Regional states increasingly will be expecting the US to contain Turkey, its nominal ally &ndash; which would mean an unusual, if not an extraordinary, change of role for Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these factors potentially point to a region that can quickly be destabilized. The worries about climate change and efforts at intensified use of renewables have created the perception that the days of oil are over. Those predictions may be correct, but they will not be realized any time soon. For the foreseeable future, Middle East oil will continue its pivotal role in fueling global economic activity. Therefore, any threats aimed at the production and distribution of this commodity risk jeopardizing global economic well being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, whether it likes it or not, the US will remain the preeminent power in the region. Some in Europe, such as France, have been willing to take on the region&rsquo;s revisionist powers, but they lack America&rsquo;s resources and relationships.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166236.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'middle-east-revisionist-powers-will-keep-the-us-engaged-in-the-region', '', '2021-11-29 11:40:36', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(186, 4, 15, 'Kidnap of Regime Officials Show Assad’s Hold on Syria Sovereignty to Be Limited', NULL, NULL, '<p>Bashar Al-Assad&rsquo;s regime in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/al-assads-election-victory-offers-the-perfect-pretext-for-the-return-of-syrias-refugees/\">Syria</a>&nbsp;has significantly expanded its territorial control in the past several years, prompting many to predict for just as long Damascus&rsquo;s coming victory and the end of the civil war. Well, not really. The reason is that the level of authority the regime enjoys inside those areas remains limited. That is especially evident in the ability of area locals to kidnap security and military officers and then to swap them for their relatives detained by the regime. The high incidence of kidnapping suggests that Al-Assad&rsquo;s government still is seen as a foe to be actively engaged one way or another, rather than a legitimate state to which people should submit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While kidnappings and prisoner exchanges have occurred throughout the Syrian conflict, today it occurs particularly in territories with delicate power arrangements between the regime and local communities, such as Daraa and Sweida. Groups like ISIS also have kidnapped and exchanged pro-regime individuals to free family members. The Assad regime has even brokered similar swap deals in the northeast, despite having friendlier relations with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and a direct military presence inside the latter&rsquo;s territories. The kidnappings show the regime not to be in sufficient control to merit being recognized as a state with full sovereignty over territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is particularly notable that kidnappings occur inside supposedly regime-held territories. Prisoner exchange is widespread in Sweida governorate in the south. The exact number of such kidnappings is unclear due to the secrecy that typically surrounds them, but a local news website has reported that over 49 military and security regime members were &ldquo;arrested&rdquo; in Sweida in 2020. The actual number of kidnappings is thus probably higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite Sweida remaining under the regime&rsquo;s control throughout the conflict, local armed groups have emerged to protect their respective communities from external threats, including the regime. It has become common for locals to kidnap military or security officers when one of their own is arrested or forcibly &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; by the regime. After verifying that pro-regime forces are behind the disappearance, victims&rsquo; relatives install mobile checkpoints either inside the city or on the main roads in search of security or military officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notably, prisoner swap deals are not limited to involving individuals detained locally. For example, a Sweida armed group installed a temporary checkpoint earlier this year on the highway linking Sweida to Damascus, which led to the kidnapping of a military officer from Latakia who served in Sweida. This kidnapping was organized by relatives of a young man who had disappeared in Homs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Daraa, the situation is slightly different. Despite being recaptured by the regime in the summer of 2018, the Russian-sponsored surrender agreements allowed former rebel groups to keep their light weapons and to maintain limited authority. For this reason, kidnapping operations in Daraa are harder to run and lesser in frequency than in Sweida. That&rsquo;s because Daraa still is considered a danger zone and, thus, regime forces move in larger groups, which makes their kidnapping more challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite those differences, negotiations in both governorates usually are initiated by the kidnappers, who delegate a mediator to hammer out a swap deal with the respective regime security agency. The mediators are usually local notables who have contact with current or retired regime officials, or with religious leaders and businessmen allied with Damascus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The length of these negotiations varies depending on where people are arrested and by which of the regime&rsquo;s security apparatus. Reaching a final deal is quicker if the arrested person is detained locally by the same security branch that is taking part in the negotiations. The Sweida example above took longer than usual because it was negotiated with the head of military security in Sweida while the arrest of the person to be swapped took place in Homs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kidnappings are a manifestation of the regime&rsquo;s tenuous hold on power. In Sweida, it has avoided direct confrontations with local armed groups because of these outfits&rsquo; strong social and religious ties to local communities. Targeting local factions could turn Sweida&rsquo;s Druze communities against the regime. In contrast, Damascus has occasionally tried to enforce its authority in Daraa, but strong local resistance and Russia&rsquo;s presence there have prevented it from achieving any real success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sensing the regime&rsquo;s powerlessness, kidnappings have ensued. And they in turn continue to destabilize Daraa and Sweida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The continuation of state-sponsored violence, violations of agreements and the lack of an independent judicial system to hold security forces accountable, strongly suggest that the kidnapping of security officials, as a form of self-protection, will likely continue for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, Al-Assad&rsquo;s expanded territorial control &ndash; such as it is &ndash; may improve the power trajectory of his armed forces, but it will fail to increase the legitimacy of his regime, even in the eyes of those who live in his grip.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166283.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'kidnap-of-regime-officials-show-assads-hold-on-syria-sovereignty-to-be-limited', '', '2021-11-29 11:41:23', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

Madrid, Oslo, Wye River, Camp David, Taba, Beirut, Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Beginning,&rdquo; Washington, the Abbas plan, Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prosperity&rdquo; vision: over the past 30 years, peace plans and roadmaps, frequently brokered by the US, have come and gone. Each has been planted in hope and some have blossomed briefly, but all have ultimately withered in the salted soil of Palestine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, as an uneasy ceasefire brought an end to 11 consecutive days of horror, world leaders are somehow once again finding the confidence to detect embers of hope in the smoldering ruins of Gaza. US president Joe Biden hailed what he saw as a &ldquo;genuine opportunity to make progress.&rdquo; Now, said UN secretary-general Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, leaders in Israel and Palestine had a responsibility &ldquo;to start a serious dialogue to address the root causes of the conflict.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone, from the schoolchildren of Gaza and Israel to their elders and leaders, knows the root causes of the conflict. During the First World War, Britain secretly gifted Palestine as a &ldquo;national home&rdquo; to the Jewish people, which in turn led to the creation of the state of Israel and the subsequent (and ongoing) displacement of Arabs from their ancestral homelands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is history. Fair or unfair, it cannot be undone. Israel is here to stay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can be done, however, is for ordinary people on both sides of the divide to take it upon themselves to rise above the poisonous narratives imposed by self-serving politicians interested not in the peaceful coexistence of human beings, but in exploiting artificial differences for the benefit of their own political ambitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week, Israel&rsquo;s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was openly accused of having attacked Gaza to divert attention away from his &ldquo;domestic challenges&rdquo; in a cynical bid to stay in power. Certainly, it is difficult to see how any leader could have authorized horror on the scale that was unleashed upon Gaza this month. Whatever the merits of either side&rsquo;s position, the imbalance of power between the Palestinians of Gaza and the Israeli state is evident in the grim accounting for the 11 days of violence: 12 Israelis lost their lives, but 230 Palestinians, including more than 60 children, lost theirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hamas, too, its power derived from the perpetuating of anti-Semitic tropes and the fighting of wars long ended, shoulders an equal burden of responsibility for the seemingly endless cycle of hate and distrust that hurts the people it claims to represent more than anyone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It isn&rsquo;t hard to demonize people, even our close neighbors, to present them as a threat to our way of life. Politicians everywhere resort to this shameful tactic to stay in power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no better example of this demonizing of others than the disgraceful scapegoating of foreigners in general and refugees in particular that preceded Britain&rsquo;s vote to leave the European Union &ndash; a vote cast by many in the misguided belief that all their problems could be blamed on people who didn&rsquo;t look, speak or pray like them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resisting this kind of manipulation isn&rsquo;t easy, as the calamity of Palestine has demonstrated for generations. But it is possible, as a remarkable event 4,000 kilometers away from Gaza showed earlier this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, the city of Glasgow in Scotland rejected the anti-foreigner propaganda of the Leave campaign and voted overwhelmingly for Britain to remain in the EU. This month, the city demonstrated the kind of human empathy that informed that vote when a large, mostly white, crowd turned out to prevent the deportation of two of their Indian neighbors, a chef and a mechanic, who had lived in the area for years but were suspected of being illegal immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protest, and the successful freeing of the men from custody, took place on Kenmure Street in Pollokshields, a predominantly white, working-class area of the city with a sizable Indian and Pakistani population. Just the sort of area, if one were to indulge in stereotyping, that might have been expected to respond to the dog-whistle propaganda of the Brexit campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, hundreds of locals rallied to the support of two men they saw not as aliens, but as part of their community, first freeing them from a UK Border Agency detention van, and then escorting them to a local mosque, where they were reunited with friends and family. Even the police, who made it clear they were on hand only to ensure public safety, declined to intervene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, the two men and their families spoke of their astonishment and gratitude for the support they had received from the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glasgow is not Gaza, of course, and the UK is not Israel. But what the miracle on Kenmure Street showed is that people have an innate ability to recognize the fundamental humanity in each other. Left to their own devices &ndash; left to live, work and play alongside each other in the pursuit of simple, everyday happiness &ndash; communities from dramatically different backgrounds can not only become one, but can find the strength to resist the attempts of politicians and governments to drive them apart.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166357.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'lessons-on-empathy-from-scotland-for-those-stoking-hate-in-the-israel-palestine-conflict', '', '2021-11-29 11:42:37', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Some of these blockages stem from an excess of bureaucratic exuberance. But in extreme cases, governments are an active impediment to the smooth functioning of business, because of endemic corruption and mismanagement (South Africa and Zimbabwe come to mind). The best way to address this is to reduce human intervention. That means a greater dependence on the intermediacy that technology can offer. Now, the bull run in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/cryptocurrencies-mainstream/\">cryptocurrencies</a>&nbsp;reveals how blockchain technology can be just that solution that reduces human input and thus impedes corruption. Coupled with the ubiquity of smartphone technology that makes phone accounts secure stores of money, blockchain is particularly suited to the African context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By now, even those who don&rsquo;t understand how blockchains work, will have woken up to their potential as they watch the soaring price of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the best known of this asset class, Ethereum, Dogecoin and others. But blockchain technology isn&rsquo;t only about cryptocurrencies. It is, at its heart, an indelible ledger system. And there lies its broader utility. The Ethereum blockchain, for example, is particularly notable in this regard. In fact, as new investments flood into the crypto market, it is kicking off a slew of new technologies specifically focused on the Ethereum blockchain and &ldquo;smart contracts&rdquo; for emerging markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A word on definitions before we go deeper. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts where the terms of the agreement are written into lines of computer code. The code &ndash; and therefore all the contract terms &ndash; exists on a decentralized blockchain network. This provides very high security for all parties, since any change or modification is trackable. Critically for emerging markets, smart contracts enable trusted transactions without the need for a central authority (like a government). The enforcement mechanism is written into the irreversible and tamperproof code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many altcoins &ndash; cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin &ndash; can provide a link between a blockchain and real-world use. Take Chainlink, itself a cryptocurrency. Chainlink can act as a bridge between smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain and real-world applications. According to its latest white paper, Chainlink has created a framework for multiple interoperating networks that will &ldquo;create a decentralized meta layer that enhances smart contracts with highly scalable, confidential and secure forms of off-chain computation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s pretty technical language. In plain English, Chainlink, which has seen its coin price jump from $11.45 at the start of this year to $46 at the time of this writing, is creating the framework needed to make smart contracts accessible for much larger segments of society. The success of its technology is one reason the coin&rsquo;s value is skyrocketing. With more money flowing from the coin valuation, Chainlink is creating a scalable smart contract that can be deployed in developing markets with otherwise weak legal enforcements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crop insurance is one possible area to benefit, holding the potential to transform life for millions in Africa. With the rise in adverse weather spurred by climate change, crop insurance is more critical than ever for farmers. However, weak legal structures make the enforcement of crop insurance claims nearly impossible in many markets like those in Africa. That&rsquo;s why, according to researchers at the Netherlands&rsquo; Wageningen University, only 3 percent of farmers in Kenya have formal insurance coverage of any type. Smart contracts can solve this problem in truly unique and clever ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A smart contract for crop insurance would function in just a few simple steps. The contractual terms and definitions (eg, what constitutes a crop failure or adverse weather condition) would be written into the programming code. A trusted third party then provides information on the contractual terms. It also decides when the terms of the contract are executable. Chainlink&rsquo;s technology would be partially focused on the last step. Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a flood in a rural part of Kenya. A trusted third-party weather service would identify this weather event, determine the extent of the probable damage to crops and then automatically execute the contract terms if the conditions are met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The farmer would then receive an agreed-upon payout sent directly to his smartphone (the other part of this story is how Africa leads much of the world in the use of smartphone accounts as a store of monetary value, so there is no need to involve banks and their staff). Everything is handled securely without the need for human intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although remarkably simple in concept, smart contracts could revolutionize the lives of millions. Not only can farmers gain access to the insurance sector and thus have access to sophisticated risk-management strategies, but smart contracts can also facilitate more formal financial inclusion efforts in developing markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is still, to be sure, a long road ahead, but the technology has reached a point where it can have a real impact in the lived world. Now, it&rsquo;s time to think about how to further develop them to provide more efficiency across emerging markets.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166432.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'how-cryptocurrencies-and-blockchains-can-help-farmers-manage-risk', '', '2021-11-29 11:43:52', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

At that time, Khartoum had not yet ratified the agreement, but it appeared nevertheless to have been a done deal. Six months on, however, the Russians are not only still waiting, but there is every chance that the deal will never happen &ndash; because the US won&rsquo;t allow it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prospect of a Russian military base in Africa, in addition to the Chinese naval base in Djibouti and Turkey&rsquo;s largest overseas military base in Somalia, has forced the US to rethink its priorities in Africa. Now, the focus of the United States Africa Command, often known as Africom, is no longer centered on the prevention of terrorism, but on the curbing of Chinese and Russian influence on the African continent. Africom&rsquo;s funding for operations doubled in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Russia, a naval base in northeast Africa would serve several purposes. African countries long have been Russia&rsquo;s main customers for military equipment. Russian energy companies Gazprom, Lukoil, Rostec and Rosatom all have invested heavily on the continent. In the past six months, Russia also has been using Port Sudan to supply weapons to the private security company, the Wagner Group, which is working for the government in the Central African Republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(In the recent past, Port Sudan served as a transshipment base for Iran to funnel weapons to Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Logistically speaking, having military facilities dotted around the world where the Russian fleet can dock for repairs and refueling, is very helpful. A naval base in Port Sudan, positioned on an extremely busy sea route, would also confer both prestige and opportunities to expand Russia&rsquo;s political and economic influence throughout East and Central Africa. It is no secret that the Kremlin is interested in large-scale business projects in Sudan, primarily in telecommunications, aviation and agriculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sudan may be one of the poorest countries in the world, but it is in the top three nations in Africa for gold mining. Sudan also has 1.5 million tonnes of proven uranium reserves and its neighbor, oil-rich South Sudan, exports energy via the Greater Nile Oil Pipeline that passes through Sudan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is hardly surprising, then, that for the US, the possibility of Russia co-opting Sudan has not only sounded a warning about the potential threat to American interests in the region, but also has forced Washington to reappraise Sudan&rsquo;s usefulness &ndash; which is why a delegation of high-ranking US military officials recently paid a visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Young, Africom&rsquo;s deputy commander for civil-military cooperation, and Rear-Admiral Heidi Berg, head of the naval intelligence directorate, were there in January. The American military sealift command&rsquo;s expeditionary fast transport ship, the USNS Carson, entered Port Sudan on February 24. Then, March 1 saw the arrival of the guided-missile destroyer, USS Winston S Churchill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Arabic media, the Khartoum government has suspended permission for the Russian naval base, which would sit just north of Port Sudan. Moscow has dismissed the claims as Western rumor-mongering. Whether true or not, the very fact that they have surfaced in public is in itself significant and certainly suggests that pressure from Washington is a major factor in Khartoum&rsquo;s delay. The US is still the main player in the Middle East and will not cede that role easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early March, Sudan received $1.15 billion from the US to repay a loan to the World Bank. In response, the World Bank announced the resumption of relations with Khartoum after nearly three decades.

(190, 4, 16, 'A Leaked Recording Could Aid Iran’s Reformers', NULL, NULL, '<p>In some respects, Iran&rsquo;s politics function a lot like more-established democracies: there are rival power factions, leaks to friendly media outlets and murky press articles meant to send political messages. The leak this month of damaging parts of an audio interview with Iran&rsquo;s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, just eight weeks before a pivotal presidential election fits this pattern. The most likely intent was to damage Zarif and the reformist camp, of which he is seen as a leading figure, ahead of the election. Yet it could, instead, aid Iran&rsquo;s reformers, by warning the West of who could be in charge after the election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recording offers an apparently unvarnished glimpse into the extent of the power of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and, in particular, its powerful former commander, Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was assassinated last year by an American drone strike. The audio suggests that, until his death, he wielded extraordinary political power, overruling government officials like Zarif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the most damaging assertion by Zarif is that military operations were never sacrificed for the sake of diplomacy, but that the converse happened on many occasions. In other words, the IRGC always got its way, even when that contradicted the aims of the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The leaked recording was part of a three-hour interview with an Iranian journalist, so it is possible the complete interview provides much more context for those comments. But the suggestion that Zarif and, by extension, much of the Iranian government are not really in charge could dampen the enthusiasm of voters eager for change and who feel exhausted after years of conflict under the Trump administration. Next, Zarif&rsquo;s criticism of Soleimani is particularly toxic to conservative voters; in the year since he was killed, the former general has acquired near-mythic status in the country. Taken together, the leak damages the reform movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hints that the reform faction believe it was leaked to hurt them came when the president, Hassan Rouhani, ordered an investigation. In an unusually blunt statement, a government spokesman called it &ldquo;a conspiracy against the government.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet there is also the possibility the leak could actually aid Iran&rsquo;s reformers who, two months out from the election, have still not settled on a candidate to continue the president&rsquo;s work. Rouhani has been in power for two terms and is ineligible to stand again, but his own political party has not yet announced who their candidate will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Zarif leak could remind Western powers that moderates are likely to lose the election, and with it the best chance of a revived nuclear deal and four years of calm. That message is particularly powerful for a White House that appears intent on governing cautiously, an administration that is pulling out of Afghanistan and offering a summit to reduce tensions with Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only lever Western powers, in particular the United States, have to affect the outcome of the election is a return to the Iran nuclear deal, which would embolden reformists at the polls. But time is tight: negotiators have met in Vienna to discuss a return, but there would need to be something substantive agreed in the next two to three weeks for the impact to be felt at the polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet obstacles abound, in Iran and in the US. Already, in America, the leaked audio is being used to attack Joe Biden&rsquo;s team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zarif claims that John Kerry, currently Biden&rsquo;s special envoy for climate, but previously secretary of state under Barack Obama, told him Israel had attacked Iranian interests in Syria at least 200 times. Zarif makes the claim to demonstrate how he was sometimes kept in the dark about what was actually happening in government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Biden&rsquo;s opponents have weaponized the leak to claim that Kerry revealed sensitive information to Iran about the military operations of an ally. Kerry has explicitly denied discussing covert operations, calling the allegations &ldquo;unequivocally false.&rdquo; The affair demonstrates how determined some in America&rsquo;s Republican party are to stop a return to the nuclear deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Western powers believe they can bolster the reformists, they will need to do something soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is, however, another inference that can be drawn from the leaked recording, and it is one that Iran&rsquo;s rivals in the region &ndash; in Egypt, among the Gulf states, in Israel &ndash; will readily conclude. It is not that Zarif&rsquo;s tussles with the IRGC suggest that the reform faction is in need of help ahead of the June election, but that, instead, those tussles prove that the political system of the Islamic Republic ultimately has just one powerful faction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interpreted that way, it suggests that a nuclear deal or not, a reformist president or not, an indiscreet foreign minister or not, Iran&rsquo;s goals will remain the same. It is that, in the words of Zarif, &ldquo;in the Islamic Republic, the military field rules&rdquo; &ndash; and nothing that happens at the ballot box will change that. Seen that way, instead of the leaked recording offering a glimpse into two warring factions, it confirms that the state is a coin with two identical faces. However the coin is flipped, it is the Guard Corps that comes up.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166583.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'a-leaked-recording-could-aid-irans-reformers', '', '2021-11-29 11:46:23', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(191, 4, 16, 'Cryptocurrency Is Now Mainstream, Whether or Not Governments Realize It', NULL, NULL, '<p>Cryptocurrencies have had an incredible time this year. It&rsquo;s no longer a question of whether they can gain mainstream acceptance &ndash; we&rsquo;re long since passed that point. Driven by fears of inflation and easy-to-understand trading platforms, cryptocurrencies now are part and parcel of a changed global monetary system. The challenge is how governments (and their regulators) react. Which countries will appreciate the technology that enables cryptocurrencies (and how will they incorporate them into their financial system), and which will instead simply turn up their nose and pretend they don&rsquo;t exist?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way we store and record value has long reflected the nature of our economy and trading system. In ancient times, we bartered goods. Then, we used precious-metal coins to store and exchange value. The invention of paper saw a further evolution in reflecting value backed by physical commodities, while fiat currency is a creation of the modern, globalized financial system. Finally, in an age increasingly defined by digital technology, cryptocurrencies, of course, make eminent sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no shortage of recent events contributing to the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies this year. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, listed its shares on Nasdaq this month. Meanwhile, major financial institutions have announced that they have put more crypto on their balance sheets, as the price of a single bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s most popular cryptocurrency, rocketed from around $20,000 in December to $65,000 earlier in April. On April 26, it traded around $53,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s electric-vehicle company, Tesla, bought roughly $1.5 billion in bitcoin and announced it would soon allow customers to purchase cars using that cryptocurrency. Dogecoin, which started as a joke based on a meme of a Shiba Inu dog, has gone up 8,100 percent this year. The total value of dogecoins in circulation currently is around $50 billion, more than the market capitalization of the hospitality company, Marriott, or Ford, the carmaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen wild price swings recently, the reason for that volatility may in fact soon give rise to greater stability. The steep rise in prices has been because of more people and institutions investing in crypto. But as more and more people and institutions become invested in crypto, the more mature and stable crypto becomes. Bitcoin has swung in the past month between about $50,000 and $65,000 &ndash; a difference of 30 percent from the lower value. By any account that is a massive price swing. But given the amount of institutional money pouring into bitcoin, coupled with global interest, the price has been roughly stable within this range. Those who have watched bitcoin evolve over the past 10 years would have expected much greater volatility. In fact, it is reasonable to expect the trading range to eventually narrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, despite the rise in prominence of crypto, there is no unified government approach toward cryptocurrencies. The Biden administration in the US says it will introduce new regulations for cryptocurrencies &ndash; but it remains unclear what they will be. Meanwhile, China, which has strict laws regulating the use of cryptocurrencies, just announced it will launch its own digital currency. Built on similar technology as bitcoin, the digital yuan could prove to be a model for governments worldwide. At the other end of the spectrum, India is mulling laws that will effectively ban cryptocurrencies &ndash; part of a larger campaign to curtail the open internet. In short, governments&rsquo; response is confused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, financial markets are being stymied. Wall Street jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon this month, but it did so without actually trading any crypto. For while participants in the US markets have been hankering for an exchange-traded fund for crypto, the Securities and Exchange Commission still won&rsquo;t allow this. For all its virtues, Coinbase remains only a proxy &ndash; its stock value is closely tied to the direction of prices of popular cryptocurrencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One argument that crypto skeptics have used against coins like bitcoin is that on a practical level they are too slow to trade. A transaction on the bitcoin blockchain can take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the volume of transactions. In the real world, no one is going to wait 15 minutes to pay for a cup of coffee. Such arguments are valid, but they fail to acknowledge the fact that crypto is a &ldquo;meta currency.&rdquo; You store value in it but you will likely still exchange it into dollars, dirhams, baht and so on to buy your coffee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or to transfer funds. Let me provide a personal example. I regularly remit money from the US to South Africa, where my wife and I live. In the past, this would require calling my American bank, paying hefty fees and waiting a couple of days for the money to arrive. Now, I purchase stable cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the price of the US dollar and thus don&rsquo;t have price volatility like bitcoin. There are many so-called &ldquo;stable coins&rdquo;; I use one called USD coin. It takes a second to buy any amount of stable coins on my crypto exchange. Then, I send them to my wife&rsquo;s crypto wallet in South Africa. The whole process takes just minutes and the fees are normally less than $2. Moreover, I can do it all on my phone with a couple of taps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent announcement that the Canadian digital asset management firm, 3iQ, will list a bitcoin fund on Nasdaq Dubai is another step in the right direction. First, it demonstrates that the UAE is lowering its resistance to crypto and embracing the technology for what it is: an integral part of the future of finance. Next, the Dubai listing follows the fund&rsquo;s listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange last year, and may lead to other listings in Singapore, Taiwan, Sweden and the US, potentially allowing for 24-hour trading in the fund and thus greater price discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To paraphrase the Nobel prize laureate, Bob Dylan, governments should get out of the way of cryptocurrencies if they can&rsquo;t lend a hand &ndash; for the times, they are truly a-changin&rsquo;.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166683.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'cryptocurrency-is-now-mainstream-whether-or-not-governments-realize-it', '', '2021-11-29 11:48:03', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

The continent is blessed with an abundance of minerals, and one of these is lithium, an essential component in making batteries for use in electric-powered vehicles and for energy storage. Lithium offers African nations an opportunity to develop their economies for the 21st century. To achieve this, they must become more than suppliers of raw materials; they must become manufacturers and claim a share of what is a multibillion-dollar industry. As Hadley Natus, chairman of the board of the mining and exploration company, Tantalex Resources Corp, puts it: &ldquo;Africa needs to become the &lsquo;go to&rsquo; continent rather than the &lsquo;take from&rsquo; continent.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa contains approximately 30 percent of the world&rsquo;s mineral reserves, but for far too long those valuable raw materials have been exported to other countries. For the countries receiving Africa&rsquo;s minerals, it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;value-addition&rdquo;; for Africa, it has become a trap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The move toward green power for utilities and car production around the world has led to a massive increase in demand for lithium-ion batteries. In this latest industrial revolution, lithium is absolutely indispensable; as a natural resource, lithium is as &ldquo;hot&rdquo; as it gets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo are two of the top 10 countries in the world for lithium reserves. In Zimbabwe, a single mine &ndash; the Bikita &ndash; holds more than 11 million tonnes of lithium ore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ampersand, a Rwandan start-up that claims to be the first electric motorbike company in Africa, secured $3.5 million from the San Francisco-based venture capitalists, Ecosystem Integrity Fund. The company intends to use the funding to grow its network of bike and battery-swap stations in Rwanda and to expand beyond its borders. Motorbike taxis are an important part of the public transit system, as well as providing employment. Ampersand has set itself the impressive target of making all of East Africa&rsquo;s motorbike taxis electric by 2030.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The investment from Silicon Valley &ldquo;further dispels the myth that electric transport will happen in rich nations first and trickle down to developing countries later,&rdquo; Josh Whale, Ampersand&rsquo;s chief executive officer, told Bloomberg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The importance of lithium &ndash; sometimes called &ldquo;white gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;the new oil&rdquo; &ndash; to Africa&rsquo;s development cannot be overstated. Lithium-ion batteries are the dominant component in storage technology due to their high-energy density and they are used increasingly in the power and transport industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, establishing any industry takes investment. But the practical arguments are on Africa&rsquo;s side. Battery production requires lithium hydroxide and most of the world&rsquo;s conversion plants are in China or Southeast Asia. To build one in Africa would cost around $300 million and would offer advantages both in terms of cost and logistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The indications are that the willingness to invest in battery production is there. Northvolt, a Swedish battery developer and manufacturer specializing in lithium-ion technology for electric vehicles, raised $1 billion for a factory in Sweden and earlier this month announced a deal to supply battery systems for the electrification of construction equipment for the Dutch multinational, Pon Equipment. Tesla and Toyota are both investing in battery production. Why not also Africa?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As to where in Africa a battery production plant might be located, logistical considerations and a well-educated workforce point to Zimbabwe as a natural choice. Trade barriers between countries within Africa will have to be removed but this is already happening through the African Continental Free Trade Agreement among 54 of the 55 nations in the African Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as well as investment, establishing an industry takes vision. The world&rsquo;s growing desire and need for green energy offer a chance to correct that, to enable Africa to take advantage of the full value chain of its resources and create a model that will be admired and emulated by the whole world.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166746.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'how-lithium-can-power-an-industrial-revolution-for-africa', '', '2021-11-29 11:49:06', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(193, 4, 16, 'Hezbollah’s Push into Supermarkets Is Accelerating the Fragmentation of Lebanon', NULL, NULL, '<p>The news that Hezbollah was officially launching its own chain of supermarkets in Lebanon was greeted with derision on social media. Photos showed shelves packed with what looked to be Iranian-sourced goods, provoking enormous, and often furious, online debate as to why the supermarkets appeared to be reserved for Hezbollah supporters only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The militant group&rsquo;s continued foray into supermarkets is part of its wider strategy of creating a parallel economy across the south of the country. But it is also part of a broader trend that the economic collapse of the country is accelerating in the retreat from the briefly flourishing idea of national consensus and the return of power to individual political parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already the national government cannot neither keep the lights on nor the banks open. Pharmacies went on strike in March and some gas stations and supermarkets have had to close because of a lack of supplies. Even the Lebanese army, traditionally one of the most apolitical and respected state institutions, is feeling the pressure: only last month, the army chief took the unusual step of uttering a public criticism, warning that the military was &ldquo;getting hungry like the rest of the people.&rdquo; The pillars of the state are weakening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some national assistance &ndash; a small loan from the World Bank was approved in March, with the money going to some of the poorest in the country. But there is nothing on the scale required; one politician suggested that three-quarters of Lebanese need financial aid. To fill the gap, political and private groups have stepped in to ensure their supporters, at least, are looked after. In addition to a social security assistance card distributed by Hezbollah, the Christian Free Patriotic Movement has solicited donations to help its members &ndash; even as it holds up the formation of a government that could start helping the majority of Lebanese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shift of focus from the national to the local is happening at the exact same time that the country is trying to form a technocratic government &ndash; responding, let&rsquo;s not forget, to pre-pandemic street protests that demanded an end to the sectarian carve-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lebanon&rsquo;s economic crisis and the pandemic may have created difficult conditions, but the political class benefits from it., for Hezbollah are not the only ones to see opportunity in the crisis. In fact, the scale of the crisis has actually given political parties a bit of breathing room from the far larger threat (from their perspective) of street protests and international pressure to curb their privileges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Street protests have claimed two governments in as many years, forcing Saad Hariri to resign in late 2019 and pushing his successor Hassan Diab out the following August. Those street protests continue to this day, although much dampened by Covid-prevention restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internationally, the pressure is being led by France, which, since the explosion in Beirut port in August, has led efforts to bring in a new government. France is supporting Saad Hariri, the former prime minister &ndash; and current prime minister-designate, if only he could form a cabinet to start governing &ndash; in his attempts to form a technocratic administration. Such a government would hopefully gain the confidence of those behind the street protests and, crucially, unlock international aid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, of course, such a technocratic government would also weaken the power base of individual political parties, which is why the Free Patriotic Movement is opposing it if there are no measures in place to preserve its privileges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So exasperated has France become with the lack of movement toward the formation of a government that it has mooted the possibility of sanctions on individual Lebanese officials &ndash; probably a reference to Gebran Bassil, the president&rsquo;s son-in-law and head of the Free Patriotic Movement. One of the last acts of the Trump administration was to sanction Bassil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such horse-trading is unfortunately part of Lebanon&rsquo;s politics. It was precisely this sort of endless, greasy, backroom politicking that first sent the Lebanese people out into the streets to protest. Unfortunately, the prolonged period of crisis will dampen any hope for genuine change to the sectarian system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a period after the Beirut port explosion last summer, there was momentum for something new, and France&rsquo;s involvement &ndash; whatever the criticisms about the former colonial power wading into Lebanon&rsquo;s domestic politics &ndash; was crucial to making the political parties sit up and take notice. But as ever, delay erodes that momentum. The longer the crisis continues, the more political parties go on catering exclusively to their supporters and not to the general public, the more the idea of a national consensus fragments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, there will be a return to business as usual, either because the pressure to simply survive becomes too much or because the international community gets exhausted and moves on. Either way, the beneficiaries will be the political parties that thrive on the status quo. It is their inertia that is holding the Lebanese people hostage.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166841.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'hezbollahs-push-into-supermarkets-is-accelerating-the-fragmentation-of-lebanon', '', '2021-11-29 11:50:41', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

It was first launched in 2016 during Chinese President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s visit to Iran but on March 27, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi signed an expanded version of the 2016 statement in Tehran, pledging bilateral cooperation on political, cultural, security and defense issues, as well as major energy and infrastructure investments with an estimated value of $400 billion over 25 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This could be a significant development for the Middle East, challenging assumptions about China&rsquo;s ambitions in the region, Iran&rsquo;s ability to pursue its economic interests despite US sanctions and, more broadly, the regional balance of power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s important to weigh up carefully, even before more details become available, what it is and what it isn&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s consider first how it could, indeed, be a pivot point for the geopolitics of the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s leaders think strategically and they may well have calculated that Iran was a long-term prospect, an energy partner and a country of consequence in the region that would enhance China&rsquo;s influence and access to the economic resources of the country and beyond. Iran&rsquo;s isolation resulting from UN and US sanctions only made the negotiations process easier, since China&rsquo;s willingness to trade and invest provides a welcome respite from the pain of multilateral pressure on Iran. Despite Iran&rsquo;s current weakness, Beijing sees the country as a strategic prize in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China may also believe that engaging with Iran could mitigate the threat of Iran championing the cause of Muslim Uighurs in western China. Iran has been active in promoting Muslim solidarity with the post-Soviet states of Central Asia which border Xinjiang. Showing respect for Iran and finding activities of mutual interest creates leverage when issues of deep cultural and religious sensitivity arise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, China may enjoy adding one more partner in its quest to challenge the values of the &ldquo;liberal international order&rdquo; created by the western powers after World War II. Iran&rsquo;s regime is of course quite illiberal when it comes to individual rights and freedoms and would share China&rsquo;s strong advocacy of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, Iran was only one stop on Wang&rsquo;s tour of the region, so it would be wrong to conclude that China has signaled a tilt to Iran over its relations with key Arab states. Wang did vaccine diplomacy in Abu Dhabi and revealed a regional security plan in Riyadh that would try to resume focusing on the two-state solution for Israel-Palestine, among other things. So the wider significance of Wang&rsquo;s trip is China&rsquo;s confidence that it can protect its interests with deeper engagement in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is a strategic agreement with Iran all about the United States? Some observers have been quick to assume that Wang&rsquo;s visit was intended to convey to the US that Pax Americana is really winding down, that the US has failed to achieve its strategic goals over decades and that the Middle East is one more platform to express strategic competition with Washington. China no longer sees the US as the natural hegemon; the region is &ldquo;in play&rdquo; for other outside actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is also possible that China hopes to demonstrate its growing confidence and influence in the region&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;causing new harm to its admittedly rocky relationship with Washington. It could explain that its visit to Iran can help bridge the acute differences in US-Iran relations. Certainly, the Biden administration has chosen to emphasize that China and the US share the view that Iran should not have nuclear weapons, suggesting that the big parties can work together to urge Iran to comply with its obligations to the UN. The Chinese might have had a hand in the resumption of talks to fully reinstate the Iran nuclear deal, which occurred very close to the Beijing-Tehran agreement. If China can claim credit, it would be a boost for Beijing&rsquo;s diplomacy and a gift to the Biden administration, which has been struggling to launch a more productive exchange with Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell if there&rsquo;s anything deeply worrying about the security aspects of the Beijing-Tehran partnership. Counterterrorism, arms sales and other bilateral defense issues were probable areas of discussion, but China seems wary of taking on any larger security responsibilities in the region, so far. But watch for port construction projects and ways it can expand its maritime presence as a precursor to a larger role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Iran, the drama of Wang&rsquo;s visit was clear. Iran&rsquo;s regime most likely felt genuine relief to have such an important visitor, a sign to struggling Iranian society that the country still enjoys respect on the world stage. And the talk of huge sums of investment may have also had an energizing effect on some sectors in Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But unlike the West, Iran&rsquo;s foreign policy is not structured around Great Power relations, or anything approaching formal alliances, or on US relations with key Asian allies. Iran has a pattern of working as the senior partner in its relations with smaller or weaker Muslim countries, where Iran&rsquo;s imperial history and its cultural impact on the region are revered and acknowledged. Iran usually is very wary of relations with stronger countries, whether it&rsquo;s Russia and the United Kingdom over the centuries, or the United States more recently. It is also prone to conspiracy theories about the intentions of outsiders; one should look for signs of Iranian anxiety as well as appreciation for the attention they&rsquo;ve received from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, for now, it may be best to watch if and how this ambitious partnership comes to life. Many of the recipients of the Chinese embrace through the Belt and Road Initiative have been bitterly disappointed. Perhaps Iran will be the exception and through a robust oil and infrastructure partnership these two countries can change history in the region. Perhaps China will do better than the US at bringing Iran and Saudi Arabia into a more productive modus vivendi, or at resolving the Palestine question. Perhaps China will find the region &ndash; Arab nations as well as Iran &ndash; receptive to some of its ideas for global governance and regional security. The cumulative effect of these core issues would indeed be a game changer.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638166977.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'is-iran-and-chinas-new-strategic-partnership-a-game-changer-for-the-middle-east', '', '2021-11-29 11:52:57', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

Because of Turkey&rsquo;s geographic position, he said, &ldquo;We do not have the luxury of turning our backs&rdquo; on either the East or West.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this sounded like Recep Tayyip Erdogan winding back the clock a decade to the era of &ldquo;zero problems with neighbors,&rdquo; then his behavior in the days before and since should have put paid to that notion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new drive for friendship wasn&rsquo;t there the weekend before when Erdogan called Joe Biden&rsquo;s comments on Vladimir Putin &ldquo;not befitting of a president.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t there two days before when, shortly after midnight, Erdogan fired the central bank governor (the third time in three years he has done so, despite international investors disliking such interference) and at the same time pulled out of a treaty against the wishes of the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t there later that same day, when Turkey&rsquo;s foreign minister, meeting his American counterpart for the first time, called the purchase of the Russian S-400 anti-aircraft system &ldquo;a done deal.&rdquo; American concern over Turkey, a Nato member, using the Russian system is at the very heart of strained relations between the two, with the US urging Turkey to get rid of the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Erdogan was offering was an adjustment of tone, not a change in substance. If Turkey does indeed want more friends, it shows no willingness to change the combative policies that led to the loss of those friends in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In just a matter of years, Erdogan has adopted a truly independent foreign policy, one neither aligned with the European Union nor the United States. Turkey, the Nato member with the largest European army, has forged an understanding with Russia; involved itself militarily in the affairs of Syria, Libya and Azerbaijan; provoked its neighbor, Greece; personally attacked the leaders of the EU&rsquo;s two most important states, Germany and France; and achieved chilly, even sub-zero, relations with both Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The price of those policies has been independence, yes, but also disappointment among former allies, alienation from powerful countries and anger from communities at home and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet reversing them is not an option. For one thing, it appears to be in Erdogan&rsquo;s personal nature to be pugnacious, reveling in political feuds. Also, fighting talk is good politics. It is the combative, argumentative, unilateralist Erdogan that the AKP party faithful want.&nbsp;His briefly conciliatory remarks last week came in what was, after all, his victory speech to his own party, after he was re-elected as chairman of the AKP. And not merely by a majority, but by a near-unanimous 1,428 votes. Only three ballots were cast against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the years since the last AKP congress, two major figures have departed: Ali Babacan, a former deputy prime minister who championed the independence of the central bank (the cause of the crisis last week that sent the Turkish lira tumbling), and Ahmet Davutoglu, a former chairman of the AKP, foreign minister and the architect of the &ldquo;zero problems with neighbors&rdquo; doctrine. Both have set up rival political parties, which shows just a how comprehensively the AKP has turned against those political stances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether the wider Turkish public agrees remains to be seen. By the time of the next parliamentary and presidential elections in 2023, the AKP will have been in power for 21 years. Erdogan will have been prime minister or president almost as long. But already, the aura of victory that has long surrounded Erdogan is dimming. Municipal elections two years ago this week saw the AKP lose control of both Istanbul and Ankara. More recent polls confirm the slide: at the start of March, polls suggested support for the AKP had fallen to 36 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therein lies the political dilemma.&nbsp;The pugnacious Sultan act is, truth be told, still working, after a fashion. Two days after Erdogan addressed the AKP faithful, the European Union stopped short of imposing sanctions on Turkey for its controversial gas exploration in waters claimed by Cyprus. It even agreed to offer more money to Turkey for hosting refugees. Causing problems with neighbors is paying off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it also carries real risks. The fall of the lira against the dollar as a result of Erdogan&rsquo;s interference in firing the central bank governor has made the weekly food shop much more expensive for many millions of Turks. In politics, this is usually an unforgivable sin.&nbsp;If Erdogan genuinely seeks friends he will have to shift from such combative policies, which could cost him support from those in the hall last week and voters like them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To win power again, he will have to appeal beyond the AKP, to a Turkey that appears more reluctant to accept a regime that is endlessly argumentative. There&rsquo;s a fine line to be trod between the faithful and the undecided. Seeking friends may mean losing his former comrades.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638167068.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'turkey-wants-more-friends-but-wont-change-behavior-thats-made-enemies', '', '2021-11-29 11:54:28', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(196, 4, 16, 'Covid-19’s Newest Symptom in Turkey: ‘Kitchen Inflation’', NULL, NULL, '<p>You know things are serious when supermarkets start locking away baby formula. Over the past year, 28,000 people in Turkey might have died of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/covid19-turkey-syrian-refugees/\">Covid-19</a>. But what is affecting people more than the virus is &ldquo;kitchen inflation.&rdquo; The pandemic has outed the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP)&rsquo;s failed agricultural policies that have sent prices of everyday foodstuffs through the roof, while growing unemployment, foreclosures and a plunging currency after the central bank chief was dismissed diminish the purchasing power of citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research Istanbul&rsquo;s February 2021 report concludes that 42 percent of citizens believe that the economy is Turkey&rsquo;s biggest problem, whereas the pandemic lags behind in third place. And it is no surprise, since food prices have increased by more than 20 percent in the past year. An average household&rsquo;s expenditure on foodstuffs is the highest among countries in the European region, with food prices in Turkey having surged more than in any other country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In a nutshell: fruit costs 58 percent more than it did pre-pandemic, vegetables are up by a staggering 89 percent and essentials such as sunflower oil are up by 50 percent. There has even been a three percent jump from November and December alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past decade, as food prices have been dropping around the world, Turkey&rsquo;s prices have been steadily rising. This is mostly due to a ruinous mismanagement of the country&rsquo;s vast agricultural sector by the AKP. Ten years ago, 23 percent of jobs were in agriculture; by 2018 it was 17 percent. Agriculture used to account for 10 percent of Turkey&rsquo;s GDP. Now it is half that. Not only have government policies devalued farming and left farmers to fend for themselves, but instead of fixing this, the AKP has chosen to rely heavily on imported goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With less land given over to cultivation and fewer people to work on it, the harvest is shrinking. Take onions, for example. Turks consume two million tonnes of them a year, but onion cultivation has decreased by 15 percent in the last decade and Turkey now has to import onions from Ukraine. A report by Greenpeace reveals that Turkey was the world&rsquo;s number one importer of wheat in 2020 after production fell to 18 million tonnes from 21 million tonnes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not a situation that can be reversed easily and certainly not in the short term. Meanwhile, the extra cost of all those imports is passed on to the consumer. The price of bread has doubled to two Turkish lira (26 US cents).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding to the crisis in Turkey&rsquo;s agriculture is the country&rsquo;s continuing struggle with chronic unemployment. Long before Covid, unemployment among 18- to 24-year-olds stood at 29 percent; it is now 35 percent. Out of a population of 84 million, 59 million people are in debt. In 2020, more than 40,000 companies and 100,000 small businesses closed down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Official figures on employment tell a confusing story; unemployment has fallen but so has the number of people who still have jobs. &ldquo;How is this possible?&rdquo; the economist Emin Capa asks. &ldquo;There is only one answer &ndash; more unofficial employment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time bankruptcies have increased. Almost three-quarters of the bakkal neighborhood grocery shops in Istanbul must let customers buy on credit, according to the Statistical Institute of Istanbul. The amount owed by customers to bakkal shops has gone up by 34 percent in the last year. The top three items people buy on credit are bread, eggs and cigarettes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than half the workforce in Turkey &ndash; 57 percent &ndash; earn the minimum wage of 2,825 lira a month &ndash; equivalent to about $350. But the Turkish Confederation of Trade Unions calculates that a low-income family of four still has to spend 2,345 lira &ndash; the equivalent of $300 &ndash; on food each month, which leaves little for everything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the AKP insists that life has become easier under its stewardship. The deputy chairman, Muhammet Emin Akbasoglu, claims that before the party came to power in 2002, a family of five could not afford to have tea and simmit (a type of Turkish bagel) three times a day. &ldquo;Today they can,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tea is one Turkish lira, simit is one lira. That makes two lira per person per meal, so 10 lira for the whole family.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On February 7, the Turkish daily, Takvim, devoted its front page to offering tips on how to save money on groceries. Such tips included: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t shop on an empty stomach&rdquo; and &ldquo;use a basket, not a trolley.&rdquo; It also urged shoppers to &ldquo;avoid nice smells.&rdquo; As advice, it may have been well-meant but many thought it insensitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, has hinted that something even more sinister is afoot and has ordered an investigation, promising, &ldquo;We will not allow a couple of greedy traders to poison our food or our country&rsquo;s people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The president has also said he expects prices to fall in the second quarter of the year. In the meantime, he has tasked the national Nourishment Committee, which was set up in 2014, to look for solutions. So far, all they have come up with is cutting VAT on some unspecified food items and removing import tariffs on others (again, unspecified). Neither will do any good if prices keep rising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Turkey, the pandemic has exacerbated a situation that had already made life difficult for many. A survey on citizen satisfaction in 2020 found that 14.5 percent of the population felt &ldquo;deeply unhappy&rdquo; &ndash; more than at any time in the last 11 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is even more disheartening is that the majority of Turks &ndash; 71 percent &ndash; do not expect their lives to get easier or better. And who can blame them? If the price of even the most basic foodstuffs continues to rise, if more people have to struggle to feed their family, a shortage of satisfaction will be the least of the country&rsquo;s worries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Alexandra de Cramer is a journalist based in Istanbul.

(197, 5, 17, 'Will Flexible Working Still Work After the Pandemic?', NULL, NULL, '<p>For people who have spent the past year working from home, speculation now is growing over when and how they will return to the office. For some, it will be a relief to be away from children and domestic chores; for others, it will mean a return to unpleasant commutes and dry sandwiches at the desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, many already are back in their cubicles. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a number of small and smaller companies have returned to a modicum of &ldquo;normalcy.&rdquo; Certainly, the daily commuter traffic testifies to this. The return is predicated on a host of issues, but mostly because these companies find&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/does-covid-19-mean-the-end-of-urbanization/\">remote working</a>&nbsp;not the most efficient way to serve their business interest and at the same time have been encouraged by falling infection numbers. Always, of course, safety will have ultimate influence. Frequent testing and hand washing, plus adjustments to the physical office environment can reduce risks further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But large companies and government departments have mostly continued to keep their staff at home. That said, business leaders are queuing up to give their views on the best possible outcomes. A survey for Microsoft suggests that 88 percent of top executives expect flexible working practices to continue. Some, however, have been quick to prepare their teams for a return to the office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banks and investment firms, most notably companies such as HSBC and Lloyds in Britain, have said that they will take the opportunity to cut back on office space and allow people to continue to work flexibly. Oil company BP has gone even further, and told staff to prepare for at least two days a week of working from home. Such companies have the deep pocket to keep investing in technology, and renew recurring licenses for online tools (something small companies with deeply eroded revenues find difficulties matching).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Middle East, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect anything to change much before the end of Ramadan, the traditional marker of corporate change in the region. After that, potentially it could get interesting. The success of vaccination programs in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, among other places, indicates that it may soon be safe for a wider phased return to the office environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, we at 3M in Dubai have already re-opened our offices, but it&rsquo;s a very gradual and phased return. The process we are following worldwide is a balance of an external environment to keep people safe, combined with a flexible approach to ensure that everybody feels safe. So far, occupancy levels are low in the UAE, as in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, South Africa and other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When conditions permit for a fuller return to office spaces, every company will need to look at itself to determine what makes sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those companies that thrive on collaboration, there is a definite advantage to having everybody on a team together &ndash; though in some ways, it has been better to have everybody on a Microsoft Teams call than the hybrid version of online/offline meetings from the past. There are, moreover, serendipitous discoveries of opportunity that come from people talking with each other informally &ndash; for example, learning of a business lead through a casual conversation over coffee in the break room. This simply cannot be replaced with scheduled online meetings. Such opportunity costs will ultimately be the incalculable business loss from the pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet others might find no appreciable difference in their business model from staying away from the physical office. Spotify, the music streaming company, has perhaps come up with the most radical of all suggestions, inviting its staff to work from anywhere, and still receive New York- or San Francisco-level salaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an ideal world, with no safety restrictions, management has the ability to be understanding of individual preferences, provided that business goals and customer needs are met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should not be surprised that as many as 88 percent of business leaders expect flexible working practices to continue. Where many of the staff are itching to get back to their desks and meet in person instead of via a screen, their wish is not necessarily to do this over five days a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flexibility must be the key for business leaders over the next 12 months and more. Like everybody else, I have learned to adapt. In 2019, I took more than 100 flights around the region, and was never in the Dubai office for more than a week at a time. The past year has taught me how to use my time smartly, and work remotely. Some people are good in the mornings; others prefer to work late into the night. Working from home offers these options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The focus should always be on output and not on input, and how best to manage people. What we need post-pandemic is a flexible solution that works for all stakeholders, including staff, customers and shareholders. We can all agree that &ldquo;work&rdquo; may never be the same again. But how we contrive to regain and improve on past efficiencies is likely to still be a work in progress.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638167341.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'will-flexible-working-still-work-after-the-pandemic', '', '2021-11-29 11:59:01', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(198, 5, 17, 'Is Offering Citizenship the Best Way to Build a Knowledge Economy in the Middle East?', NULL, NULL, '<p>A key element of the current rise of emerging markets is the movement of people. This is due to several overlapping factors. The growth in the aviation sector means there are more and cheaper flights connecting the world. At the same time, internet connectivity and the proliferation of increasingly sophisticated smartphones is enabling entrepreneurs everywhere to operate remote offices and access the best talent across the emerging world. Now, a new initiative by Saudi Arabia offers an opportunity to parse the desirability of offering citizenship to international talent versus offering soft infrastructure to global nomads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Singapore to Dubai, emerging hub cities attract talent because of their world-class infrastructure, aviation sector and friendly business environment. If you want proof of just how important these hubs are to the emerging market economy, consider this: the two largest technology acquisitions in the history of the Middle East came from companies based in Dubai operated by expatriates. Careem, the ride-hailing service that operates across the Middle East and North Africa, was acquired by Uber this year for $3.1 billion. The company was founded by a Pakistani and a Swede who met while working for McKinsey.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://souq.com/\">Souq.com</a>, an online retailer started by a Syrian entrepreneur, was bought by Amazon for $580 million in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brains behind these companies didn&rsquo;t move to Dubai with the hopes of acquiring Emirati citizenship. They moved because Dubai offered a business environment unlike any other in the world. Dubai&rsquo;s favorable tax rates, access to major markets and solid infrastructure translate into an ideal home base for a company like Careem and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://souq.com/\">Souq.com</a>. Aramex, the global shipping company, also set up shop in the UAE for these reasons. It is one of the most valuable companies in the Middle East. The fact that the UAE government has made building a knowledge economy a key priority means that even more resources will go into infrastructure and initiatives such as &ldquo;e-business residency,&rdquo; whereby entrepreneurs can set up virtual companies in the country regardless of where they operate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These policies are working and other Gulf nations are taking note. Many technology startups, especially in financial technology, are also setting up shop in Dubai. In my reporting on FinTech startups around the African continent, I have noticed one common thread: entrepreneurs from this sector all spend a great deal of time in Dubai for meetings, conferences and to raise capital. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for these startups to operate small offices in the UAE just to maintain a foothold where the action is taking place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the UAE&rsquo;s success in transforming Dubai into an economic hub of the emerging world, other Gulf nations are beginning to emulate the Emirati model. Saudi Arabia is the most notable example. As part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&rsquo;s plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from hydrocarbons and toward technology, the country has invested heavily in the knowledge economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia also is opening its doors to the world. Visa on arrival is now available for citizens of several countries and special investor visas have been minted. Gulf nations historically have been reluctant to offer citizenship to foreigners and expatriates even though they are hosts to large foreign-born populations. But this month, King Salman announced that citizenship would be offered to outstanding members of the science, medical and technology community who have lived in the kingdom for more than five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an attempt to attract talent, the Saudi initiative is laudable. But it misses the mark. The kind of established top talent it targets is probably already happy with the citizenship they have. Instead, such programs are more usefully employed in talent spotting future leaders in their fields. Even then, citizenship is only one component in the array of opportunities offered to them. It might even be the last item on the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of all this as a horizon of possibilities. In emerging markets, collaboration is happening across borders, facilitated by internet connectivity and travel. As a consequence, citizenship is increasingly a secondary concern. Entrepreneurs are travelling between countries more than ever. Hence, the expansion of ease of entry, as opposed to the offer of a passport, may be the greater virtue and enabler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest initiative in Dubai to offer e-business registration arguably is more in line with the nature of the technology economy than an offer of citizenship to individuals. Based on Estonia&rsquo;s widely successful e-residence program, the Dubai plan will allow businesses to incorporate electronically and then operate from anywhere. They will benefit from the UAE&rsquo;s business and legal infrastructure without having to leave the markets where their products are being developed and used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the size of the Saudi economy, a similar program could have even greater benefits. The aim should be to respond to the needs of young companies. And what startups need most is flexibility. Through infrastructure investment and favorable business regulations, Saudi Arabia could easily attract talent from across emerging markets who are able to travel to the kingdom easily when they need to. If Saudi Arabia can offer attractive and flexible conditions for the next generation of global entrepreneurs, there will be a waiting line to set up shop.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638167392.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'is-offering-citizenship-the-best-way-to-build-a-knowledge-economy-in-the-middle-east', '', '2021-11-29 11:59:52', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(199, 5, 17, 'Local and Geopolitics Intrude in Israel’s Attempt to Supply Europe with Gas', NULL, NULL, '<p>Usually positioned on the margins of the Middle East&rsquo;s complex energy politics, Israel now is a legitimate player in its own right. More than a decade ago, large natural-gas fields were discovered off Israel&rsquo;s northern coast in the Mediterranean. Since then, it has scrambled to determine exactly how the gas will make its way to Europe, principally, but also to other markets in Africa. For unlike the traditional energy politics of its neighbors, Israel has far more political issues to contend with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The French energy conglomerate, Total, highlighted the issues last month when its chief executive, Patrick Pouyanne, told the Financial Times that Israel was &ldquo;too complex&rdquo; for investment. Pouyanne further explained that Total was unwilling to put its other relationships in the region at risk by inking fresh deals with Israel. This should be no surprise, as Total likely still wants to partner with Iran in a gas-exploration deal that has now been put on hold because of renewed American sanctions. Additionally, the company has been working closely with Lebanon to explore the country&rsquo;s offshore gas potential in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are almost certainly additional pressures on the company that its executive doesn&rsquo;t want to mention. Over the past decade, boycott activists have been successful in pressuring European companies to end business relationships in Israel. As a consequence, the French company, Systra, for example, pulled out of the Jerusalem light-rail project, while the British security company, G4S, ended its business in Israel. That is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the high stakes surrounding Israel&rsquo;s natural-gas fields, Total cannot want to face the prospect of a civil-society boycott that would almost certainly be backed by the movement&rsquo;s like-minded allies in Lebanon and state-inspired ones in Iran. This is not to say that the movement, by itself, is in a position to inflict significant damage on the Israeli economy. Rather, it can be a massive irritant to business. It has the power to make deals that much more &ldquo;complex&rdquo; and bothersome for companies that wish to do business in or with Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, seeing its bet in Iran fall to pieces, one might suppose that Total should want to consider changing sides and working closely with Israel. But the ever-present prospect of the boycott makes such a shift fraught with potential controversy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other factors at play that cast the entire issue in a more global light. When Israel first made its gas find, there was a strong push to export the gas through Turkey to Europe. Turkey, which is energy deprived but centrally located, has been trying to cast itself as an energy hub linking energy-producing regions in the Middle East with Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then politics intruded. Israel and Turkey&rsquo;s relations soured after the Arab Spring, as Ankara sought to position itself as a champion of change in the region, while Israel began to court new allies in the region while entrenching its occupation of the West Bank. As Turkish bets on the Arab Spring failed to materialize, the country draped itself in the Palestinian cause as a way of demonstrating its soft power in the hearts and minds of many across the Middle East. The rhetorical wars have put a serious stain on Turkey and Israel&rsquo;s relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of last year, the Turkey pipeline was sunk. With help from the United States, a new $7 billion EastMed pipeline project was conceived that would transport gas from Israel&rsquo;s offshore fields to mainland Greece through Cyprus and Crete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once fully operational, the pipeline will deliver 10 billion cubic meters of gas per annum to energy-hungry markets in the European Union, which will bring in billions of dollars for Israel, Greece and Cyprus while providing lower gas fees for northern customers who have been dependent on Russia and other Middle East countries until now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then again, Israeli political complexities in Levantine energy deals might soon face competition. For in another sign of the dizzying complexity of gas politics in the Mediterranean, Moscow has led its own exploration efforts in waters off the Syrian coast (and in Lebanon, in partnership with Total, as previously mentioned). Any significant discovery likely will be exported to Turkey, given its proximity to the fields and its recently upgraded relationship with Russia. Yet none of this necessarily answers the question of ultimate sovereignty over those assets until the Syrian conflict is &ndash; somehow &ndash; concluded definitively. Nevertheless, not only does Russia want a part in any further Mediterranean gas discoveries, but it has an interest in protecting its role as Europe&rsquo;s primary natural-gas supplier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relations between Russia and Israel currently are good. The two regularly communicate about Russian actions in Syria, and the presence of over one million Russians in Israel helps maintain cultural and social links. But once Israeli gas begins flowing into the European Union, the relationship could soon strain as Russia&rsquo;s economy depends significantly on revenue from Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, in comparison, hydrocarbon extraction and supply in the Middle East&rsquo;s GCC states have proven far more straightforward for the energy majors. The complexity of politics &ndash; local and international &ndash; in the Levant will therefore factor increasingly in calculations of companies such as Total. Is the hassle of working in, or with, Israel worth the addition to the bottom line?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, Israel is moving quickly with the help of the US in a bid to transform Europe&rsquo;s energy market. But geopolitics &ndash; leavened with a large dose of local activism &ndash; can change economic calculations. And this makes Israel&rsquo;s &ndash; and the Levant&rsquo;s &ndash; energy calculus always complex and never a settled matter.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638167459.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'local-and-geopolitics-intrude-in-israels-attempt-to-supply-europe-with-gas', '', '2021-11-29 12:00:59', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

For while the delay afforded extra time for countries to prepare, early containment strategies now have fallen apart. This is thanks to mismanagement and poor governance. South Africa, the most industrialized country on the continent, is a case study of the latest missed opportunities. Instead of using the disruption from the pandemic to reset the status quo in favor of competent government, Covid-19 has allowed the most inefficient aspects of governance to reassert themselves.

Now, with the people united in the battle against Covid-19, was this not the moment finally to drive through such a change? One would think so. But alas, it was not to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 26, before a single death from Covid-19 was registered, South Africa closed down most economic activity. Citizen movement was prohibited for all but the most essential of purposes. Even e-commerce outlets were forced to sell only the most basic and essential of goods.

The restriction on alcohol sales was predicated on the necessity to mitigate health risks associated with alcohol, and thus free up space in the country&rsquo;s hospitals to handle Covid-19 patients. Tobacco was prohibited because smoking weakens the respiratory system. In addition, the practice of sharing cigarettes among poorer people in the country was deemed a risk in spreading the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Africa&rsquo;s response and lockdown were widely praised as an instance of exemplary leadership by Ramaphosa. And as other countries followed suit, Africa&rsquo;s response to Covid-19 was being hailed as among the best in the world. The Africa editor of the Financial Times wrote in April, &ldquo;Many Africans have scant faith in governments and elites that too often have wielded power to enrich themselves. The response to Covid-19 is a glimpse &ndash; no more than that &ndash; of how things could be different.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, a glimpse of the most fleeting kind is what it proved to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In South Africa, even when it became clear that the curve had flattened as much as was possible, Pretoria stubbornly and inexplicably refused to relax the lockdown &ndash; despite the fact that lives were being lost through sharply deepening poverty and starvation. Despite vocal opposition from the finance ministry and the country&rsquo;s leading scientists, the National Command Council on Covid-19 (NCC) refused to explain its decisions. Glenda Gray, one of the country&rsquo;s leading scientists and a world-renowned AIDS researcher, slammed the government for imposing &ldquo;irrational&rdquo; and &ldquo;unscientific&rdquo; regulations. Among the more bizarre of these was the decision to allow the sale of winter clothing but not summer clothes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial support for Ramaphosa and his government now has all but evaporated. And under intense pressure from the public, many of the ad hoc regulations have been eased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the ban on tobacco sales remains, largely at the insistence of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minister publicly reversed the president&rsquo;s decision to allow tobacco sales from early May, claiming that she had received &ldquo;more than 2,000&rdquo; messages from concerned members of the public asking for the ban to be continued. Whatever the truth of that, all it did was prompt speculation about corruption within the NCC and, more particularly, about the minister&rsquo;s connections with Adriano Mazzotti, a notorious cigarette smuggler. Although Dlamini-Zuma has denied any relationship or impropriety, there remains reported allegations that Mazzotti contributed to her campaigns in the past. (Mazzotti has denied these allegations.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alcohol now is available again. But only Monday through Thursday. One justification for the weekend ban is that in South Africa, which has a high rate of violent crime, half of murders occur at the end of the week and more than half of victims have elevated alcohol levels in their blood. But the limited ban doesn&rsquo;t mean alcohol isn&rsquo;t available at all &ndash;just not legally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire pandemic response and its aftermath has left South Africans baffled and angry as it all unravels into a mess of mismanagement, lack of communication and poorly justified regulations. Business as usual, in other words. The Johannesburg-based journalist, William Shoki, has accused the government of &ldquo;using the crisis to avoid all oversight and transparency, hiding behind the experts &ndash; and even then, often publicly contradicting what their experts are saying.&rdquo; With the economy in ruins and the healthcare sector still reeling, the biggest winners after two months of lockdown appear to be traders in contraband tobacco and alcohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Ramaphosa was elected to stop the rot of corruption and put South Africa on a true path forward. At first, it seemed that the coronavirus pandemic presented an opportunity to deliver on his promises. Instead, it has turned out to be another opportunity missed in a sorry series of opportunities lost. And where Pretoria leads, the rest of Africa follows, so brace for it. That is the compounded tragedy of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638167557.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'for-south-africa-covid-19-has-ultimately-meant-business-as-usual-and-thats-bad-news-for-the-rest-of-africa', '', '2021-11-29 12:02:37', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Iran is engaged in a series of missteps that will land it further in financial pain, rather than war. The reason for that is because from the Trump administration&rsquo;s point of view, these sanctions are working to achieve their goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On June 13, the Iranian regime allegedly orchestrated attacks against two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. This development followed a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency confirming that Iran was increasing its production rate of low-enriched uranium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These actions follow a series of measures by the US Treasury Department, which on June 12 imposed sanctions on a financial conduit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force, and on June 7 sanctioned Iran&rsquo;s largest petrochemical holding group. US officials are also considering sanctions against the Iranian financial body that was established as a trade channel with Europe &ndash; a move that would underscore US intolerance to any international workarounds to the Iran sanctions campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need to read the tea leaves too closely to know the administration&rsquo;s plan for its &ldquo;maximum pressure&rdquo; campaign. But one thing the tea leaves don&rsquo;t show are plans for war. And the reason is simple: the sanctions are working; they are helping to achieve President Donald Trump&rsquo;s priority goal, which is to undermine Iran&rsquo;s influence and support for terrorism in the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury&rsquo;s latest steps follow a State Department press briefing, during which its spokesperson, Morgan Ortagus, listed the negative effects Iran sanctions were having on that country&rsquo;s terrorist proxies and on its other actions in the region. She pointed to the Lebanese group Hezbollah&rsquo;s &ldquo;pleas for public donations via billboards, posters and collection cans&rdquo; and stressed that &ldquo;Iran is withdrawing Hezbollah fighters from Syria and cutting or canceling their salaries.&rdquo; This is a big deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also pointed to Hamas&rsquo;s austerity plan in Gaza and to the IRGC&rsquo;s budget cuts for Iraq Shia militia groups. She highlighted fuel shortages in Syria due to the cut in Iranian oil supply and noted the IRGC cyber command &ldquo;is short on cash.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others have also picked up on this emerging trend: that Iran sanctions are starving Iran&rsquo;s proxies of critical funds. The Washington Post reported that US sanctions against Iran have &ldquo;curtailed&rdquo; Iran&rsquo;s finances to Hezbollah, which &ldquo;has seen a sharp fall in its revenue and is being forced to make draconian cuts to its spending.&rdquo; A fighter with an Iranian-backed militia in Syria told The New York Times that he lost a third of his salary and other benefits, lamenting, &ldquo;Iran doesn&rsquo;t have enough money to give us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or what is often called the Iran nuclear deal, last year, President Trump made his top goal clear. Before even addressing Iran&rsquo;s nuclear capabilities or speaking about working toward a new agreement, he emphasized Iran&rsquo;s support for terrorism and plans for regional influence as among his key concerns and reasons for withdrawing from the deal. Working to undermine that behavior has been the administration&rsquo;s top priority in its Iran policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take Hezbollah. If you look closely, the US has worked over many years to inflict financial pain on the terrorist organization. Could heavy Iran sanctions be the arrow through Hezbollah&rsquo;s heart?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US government says its Iran sanctions are having an effect in inflicting financial pain on the group. But we also know that Hezbollah maintains global business enterprises and active global criminal activity to heavily supplement its allowance from Iran. Dating back to the Bush administration, the US Treasury has focused on targeting Hezbollah&rsquo;s business operations and sanctions-evasion conduits to further expose its illicit financial behavior and to rachet up pressure on it. And those efforts have increased over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the threat of secondary sanctions and deliberately broad language in the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Amendment Act, passed last year, has made Lebanese banks uncertain as to who or what the Treasury Department will target next &ndash; a maneuver that helps deter anyone from doing business with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to further isolate Hezbollah and undermine its influence, however, more needs to be done to expose and target Hezbollah&rsquo;s global business and criminal behavior, particularly by the US&rsquo;s global partners and by Europe, specifically. Nonetheless, Iran sanctions, while not the silver bullet, are making a real, tangible difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the goal is to undermine Iran&rsquo;s nefarious behavior and the strong support it offers to terrorist groups and other militants in the region, then the strategy appears to be working. And for that reason, the administration is likely to continue focusing on targeted financial measures as its tool of choice.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638167651.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'trumps-sanctions-are-working-and-will-prevent-war-with-iran-and-reduce-tehrans-influence-in-the-middle-east', '', '2021-11-29 12:04:12', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

(202, 5, 18, 'An African Free-Trade Area and Growing Middle East-Africa Ties Are Key to Prosperity', NULL, NULL, '<p>If you want to understand our collective future, look no further than Africa. Let&rsquo;s start with the obvious, Africa&rsquo;s demographics. According to UN projections, Africa&rsquo;s population is set to double by 2050 to 2.4 billion. Looking further ahead to the year 2100, Africa&rsquo;s population is expected to hit 4.3 billion. By that time, some one-third of all of humanity will live on the continent. Amid all the talk of the 21st century being the Asian Century, Africa is on pace to nearly catch up with Asia by the end of the century. Could the 22nd century be the African Century?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But before we go that far, let&rsquo;s look at one of the biggest challenges facing Africa today and in the near future: jobs. When Africa hits 2.4 billion people, some one-third will be youth, according to the African Development Bank. That means 800 million new jobs will be needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The African Development Bank referred to the continent&rsquo;s population growth over the next three decades as a &ldquo;ticking time bomb.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why the new African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) is so important. Signed by virtually every African nation, it came into force on May 30, and creates the world&rsquo;s largest free-trade area since the establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1995. Foreign investors often complain about the lack of intra-African trade, making investments in smaller countries a harder sell. Nigeria (population nearly 200 million) is interesting; Niger (population just north of 20 million), not so much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AfCFTA is a good start, but don&rsquo;t expect a revolution overnight. Tremendous obstacles remain and free-trade agreements of this size and scope among predominantly developing countries will require years, even decades, to mature into something broadly accepted, workable and beneficial. But amid the current caricature negative depictions of globalization rising in parts of Europe and the United States, the AfCFTA is a powerful counter-current &ndash; and a much needed one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the median age in Africa is 20. By contrast, the median age in the advanced economies of Europe, the US and Japan is 42. With such a young population, the UN estimates that African countries will need to create 18 million jobs a year through the year 2035.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where will these jobs come from? In the age of manufacturing automation, low- and semi-skilled jobs are moving to robots. Compounding the problem across Africa, at least for the short term, is the ongoing US-China trade war, which has the potential to knock both countries back a peg. Given China&rsquo;s vital role as a major importer of African commodities and investor in infrastructure, and America&rsquo;s role as a major foreign direct investor, the trade dispute will have a knock-on effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is, of course, another side of the Africa story. This is the story of economic transformation, of young entrepreneurs creating and innovating, of large enterprises going regional and sometimes global and of growing middle classes driving a consumer boom in major cities. The &ldquo;Africa Rising&rdquo; narrative may have gotten ahead of itself, though perhaps it served a useful correction to the &ldquo;hopeless continent&rdquo; narrative of the Economist magazine cover story from 2000. Today, however, it&rsquo;s time to stop worrying about the narratives and start getting down to business &ndash; yes, business. While aid plays a role, what major African countries need &ndash; just like any other country &ndash; is private sector-led growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is where cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Morocco come in. One of the defining features of our era today is the massive growth in South-South trade and investment. Countries across the &ldquo;global South&rdquo; are no longer waiting for the West to &ldquo;save&rdquo; them with aid or to invest in their markets; instead, they are increasingly also engaged with other emerging markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dubai has become something of a Miami for Africa, a major hub for African business, trade, finance and tourism, while UAE entities have become major investors across the continent. Companies like the Abu Dhabi-based Etisalat and Dubai-based Emirates have become household names across the continent, and are major trade and connectivity enablers; the Dubai-based ports operator, DP World, runs eight marine and inland terminals on the continent. There are an extraordinary 12,000 African businesses registered with the Chamber of Commerce in Dubai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia recently announced a major petrochemical and refinery investment in South Africa as part of $10 billion of planned investments. Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s knowledge in building large-scale industrial enterprises &ndash; the kind that create lots of jobs &ndash; like Saudi Aramco and the petrochemical company SABIC should be shared widely across the continent. Turkey continues to invest broadly across African markets and Turkish Airlines serves as a force multiplier of connectivity, while Morocco has positioned itself well as an air, finance and education hub linking Europe to sub-Saharan Africa. Egypt is seeking to use its tech talent to become a digital hub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this is positive, but it&rsquo;s not one-way. Sub-Saharan African entrepreneurs and businesses can enrich the broader Middle East and North Africa region with their dynamism and ability to achieve scale and breakthroughs in often difficult circumstances. African creative industries deserve mention here. Aubrey Hruby, an astute observer of all things to do with African business, notes that &ldquo;African film, music, and fashion are exploding on the world stage&rdquo; and the Nigerian film industry and South African visual-arts sector are only at the beginning of their growth. Lessons can be drawn and shared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every year, Dubai hosts the World Government Summit, a gathering of notables that seeks to tackle our world&rsquo;s biggest challenges. While it is useful to hear from the Managing Director of the IMF, there is nothing more heartening for a mayor of an African or a Middle Eastern city to sit with a counterpart and exchange ideas. Sure, Zurich or Paris may have an innovative solution to a city problem, but when a municipal official in Cairo learns something useful from a municipal official in Lagos, they are, in some ways, speaking the same language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that respect, cross-border trade and investment flows linking the broader Middle East with Africa can enrich both sides, but it&rsquo;s not only about the numbers. The dialogue must become much more robust. There&rsquo;s a lot Dubai can learn from Dakar, and a great deal that Abu Dhabi can share with Addis Ababa.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638167899.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'an-african-free-trade-area-and-growing-middle-east-africa-ties-are-key-to-prosperity', '', '2021-11-29 12:08:19', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(203, 5, 18, 'A Litany of Problems for Western Energy Majors May Not Spell Opportunity for Gulf National Oil Companies', NULL, NULL, '<p>Saudi Aramco&rsquo;s IPO is wending its way toward its d&eacute;nouement, and the world&rsquo;s largest petroleum conference is taking place this week in Abu Dhabi. Major international oil firms, on the other hand, are reporting slumping profits and investment. These events suggest a sharp divide between Middle East state-owned energy giants and their investor-owned Western counterparts. But in fact, both face challenges. And while some might sense an opportunity for the large state oil firms to take over assets and market share from the Western majors, they may not have sufficient resources to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the majors. Shell, BP, Total, Chevron and ExxonMobil reported sharply lower earnings in the third quarter, a result of relatively low oil prices and the collapse in prices of natural gas in major European and Asian markets. American shale fields, once the province of buccaneering wildcatters, are now becoming that of the supermajors &ndash; though they have yet to convince investors they can produce sustainable cashflow where their predecessors failed. Meanwhile, their traditional bread-and-butter &ndash; giant projects in remote locations &ndash; is being viewed with skepticism, too. ExxonMobil&rsquo;s share price is down 12 percent since April, despite having opened up one of the world&rsquo;s most promising new oil prospect, off Guyana; investors want fast, low-risk paybacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European majors, including Shell, BP, Total and Equinor, face a further pressure not yet really felt by the Americans &ndash; the demand to act on climate change. There is growing attention to &ldquo;stranded assets,&rdquo; the idea that future restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions will make much of their current oil and gas business unprofitable. This fear is overstated for now. Nevertheless, some investors have withdrawn from the sector entirely, while most demand a clear plan for these businesses to become &ldquo;climate-compatible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, with all the difficulties with fossil fuel, European firms are entering new businesses: offshore wind, solar power, electricity retailing, electric-vehicle charging and battery development, for example. (Shell&rsquo;s purchase this month of the French floating wind power developer, Eolfi, is the latest development.) It remains to be seen if the oil companies&rsquo; skills can transfer to these new businesses. Still, each will have to make a giant acquisition to build a really material low-carbon business. These are clearly not easy times for the majors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the giant national oil companies (NOCs), such as Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and Qatar Petroleum, face a two-fold challenge. They are called upon to support their countries&rsquo; transformation plans, to move to a post-oil economy. And they, too, must confront challenges related to the climate crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NOCs, usually the best-run entities in their home countries, and with formidable capital, have sought to generate more value beyond simple extraction and sale of hydrocarbons. All are expanding their downstream business &ndash; the processing, transporting, trading and marketing of oil and gas. They are building giant integrated refineries and petrochemical complexes, particularly in joint ventures to access fast-growing Asian markets, initially China and now India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the upstream sector, they are focusing on gas, mostly to meet domestic needs. Aramco, additionally, has invested in US liquefied natural gas as part of its plans to build an international portfolio. Qatar, the world&rsquo;s largest LNG exporter, is pressing ahead with plans to expand capacity by 40 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By and large, then, the NOCs don&rsquo;t have the same difficulties with fossil fuel that their Western counterparts are experiencing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about the much-taunted diversification away from fossil fuel? True domestic diversification beyond oil, in fact, has been halting. The NOCs face tension between investing in their core businesses and funding the reinvention of their host countries. This tension is most apparent in the long-running saga of the Saudi Aramco IPO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aramco had historically been a technocratic island of excellence, managing the kingdom&rsquo;s vast oil resources efficiently. But that changed with the announcement of the IPO in 2016, ironically intended to bring about more transparency and a commercial mindset. In 2018, Aramco was instructed to buy the Public Investment Fund&rsquo;s 70 percent stake in Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation, more commonly known as SABIC, for a price Aramco considered to be inflated. The shares have dropped about 30 percent since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September, the respected Aramco long-time executive, Khalid Al Falih, was replaced by Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as oil minister, and by the chairman of the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Yasir Al Rumayyan, as Aramco chairman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aramco is now guaranteeing hefty dividends to boost its valuation in the forthcoming IPO, which will initially be limited to the local stock market, and to maximize the transfer of money to the PIF. The PIF, in turn, is expected to spearhead the kingdom&rsquo;s transformation by building the futuristic city of Neom and taking stakes in tech firms such as Tesla, Uber and, via the Softbank Vision Fund, the infamous WeWork. Such then is the vision of the old economy funding the new. But for Aramco, this plan may limit its ability to continue investing in its core business, especially if oil prices fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOCs may seek to be &ldquo;last one standing,&rdquo; as carbon limits and falling oil prices drive out their high-cost international competitors. But that itself requires heavy investment, and still faces climate-crisis constraints. As the majors, especially European firms, gradually step away from oil, the space might open for bold acquisitions by the NOCs. But they can only bridge the gap if their host governments simultaneously wean themselves off petrodollars.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638167939.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'a-litany-of-problems-for-western-energy-majors-may-not-spell-opportunity-for-gulf-national-oil-companies', '', '2021-11-29 12:08:59', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

The gaze of the world, when cast toward the Middle East, now hovers over Libya, lingers on Lebanon and then alights on Iraq, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. There is much misery in the region competing for attention. That said, suffering has not abated in Syria, either. Conditions continue to deteriorate despite the winding down of war. In this new phase, the state has resorted to another way to &ldquo;manage&rdquo; the everyday living condition of Syrians: extortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bashar Al Assad&rsquo;s main backers, Iran and Russia, may have assisted massively to help the regime win the war. However, neither has been able to sufficiently help Al Assad with the economy. Economic output has declined sharply &ndash; GDP in 2018 was estimated at just 35 percent of pre-war levels. And much of what resources remained were reallocated toward war-related activities. The concomitant drop in useful output has weighed heavily on the Syrian currency. The value of the Syrian pound plunged by half in 2016, and is now worth about a fifth of its value since the start of the conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regime&rsquo;s focus currently is on stabilizing the pound, in order to control runaway inflation that has ramped up the price of essential goods and, in fact, everything else. Toward this end, Al Assad forced wealthy pro-government businessmen, including his cousin, Rami Makhlouf, to deposit foreign exchange with the central bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of Syria&rsquo;s business elites, especially those who continued to operate throughout the conflict, accumulated their wealth through their connections with the regime. Thus, Al Assad may have felt entitled to ask them to return the favor. A large number of notable business figures &ndash; such as Samer Foz, Mohammad Hamsho, Waseem Al Qattan and Bara&rsquo; Al Katerji &ndash; were summoned for a shakedown. The meeting was held in September at the Sheraton hotel in Damascus under the strict condition of secrecy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to various sources, the attendees were pressured to make US dollar deposits to the central bank with the aim of making foreign exchange available to be sold at a dollar-to- pound rate lower than the prevailing market price. By October 15, the total value of deposits in a special account at the central bank was nearly $1 billion, according to a member of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce, Hassan Azqoul, in a report in Emmar Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite an initial bump in the value of the pound, with each dollar buying 615 pounds, the rate quickly continued its inexorable decline. Today, a dollar fetches around 1,050 pounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So now, the regime has come up with a different tactic to secure more foreign exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A crackdown has begun against allegedly corrupt businessmen, to force them to hand over some of their wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most prominent among such businessmen targeted is Rami Makhlouf, who has been placed under investigation. Many of his assets have been seized or frozen, including a chain of hotels, duty-free shops, finance firms and the country&rsquo;s main mobile-phone service provider, SyriaTel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regime has also targeted government officials for allegedly having indulged in illicit financial activities. Among them are Hazwan Al Waz, who served as education minister between 2012 and 2018, and Fadi Al Dabbas, the former president of the Football Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a source close to the regime, many of the business figures were targeted because they did not initially deposit their dollar hoards with the central bank, or because their participation was not deemed satisfactory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, some, like Wasim Kattan, reportedly were verbally told to pay up or to face consequences. Kattan apparently did as &ldquo;advised,&rdquo; and scrutiny into his affairs was terminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The selective and transactional nature of the supposedly anti-corruption campaign has attracted attention even among the regime&rsquo;s sanctioned media outlets. Consequently, the issue was brought up in a TV interview by the Syrian News Channel with Al Assad himself. He claimed that the &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; campaign began more than three years ago, but that the effort did not gain public attention until prominent business and government figures were ensnared. He also admitted that businessmen who attended the Sheraton hotel meeting in September were asked to help state institutions, notably the central bank, and that they did so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Al Assad&rsquo;s response confirms that the regime is unable to use conventional means to overcome the country&rsquo;s financial and economic crisis. Thus, those, including cronies and warlords, who benefited from Syria&rsquo;s war economy are being forced to contribute to stabilizing the currency. Whatever effects might come, however, will be short-lived in a country under sanctions and able to trade only mostly with the like Iran and Russia. This will not end well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, most Syrians will continue to find it difficult to scrape together the cost of a cup of coffee at the capital&rsquo;s Sheraton.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638167988.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'with-syrias-economy-and-currency-in-crisis-assad-turns-to-extortion', '', '2021-11-29 12:09:48', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Although they do not resolve the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, the Abraham accords create positive momentum for greater interaction, communication and stability in the Middle East. Apart from geostrategic considerations, there was initial optimism that the accords would lead to tighter economic relations and an increase in investment and trade. This is already manifesting itself in landmark investment deals, but in the longer term, more work may be required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, there already have been remarkable events showcasing the changes in regional geopolitics and investment. Direct flights have taken place between Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Khartoum, Manama and Rabat. Thousands of tourists have flooded from Israel to Dubai, where the first public celebration of Hannukah was marked by the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, displaying a Hebrew message in front of a large graphic of a menorah. And in December, the UAE&rsquo;s Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Nahyan bought 50 percent of the Israeli soccer club, Beitar Jerusalem, while an Israeli-UAE consortium agreed to buy Finablr, a London-based international payments and exchange company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are all developments to be applauded and celebrated, and there will be further progress in 2021, particularly involving the UAE, which is enthusiastically engaging in economic activity with Israel. DP World has expressed interest in investing in Israeli ports and logistics facilities, which will allow the firm to link up the Gulf to the Mediterranean. Emirati investors have also been assessing strategic investments in technology, agribusiness and financial services, while the ministries of energy in the two countries have discussed opportunities for cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even with the flurry of initial investments and enthusiasm on both sides for deepening economic engagement, there are also barriers to trade and investment that may serve to limit the extent to which such opportunities can be realized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an example, Israel&rsquo;s Trading with the Enemy Ordinance forbids Israeli companies from doing business with any person that has been &ldquo;conducting business in an enemy state&rdquo; or any entity that &ldquo;conducts business under the supervision of an enemy state.&rdquo; The definition of an enemy state is somewhat vague, but the finance ministry lists current enemy states as Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAE, to its credit, is a diverse society that has acted as a commercial magnet for people around the world, and in particular the Arab world. As such, the relationship some of its companies have had or continue to maintain with some regional firms and individuals could prevent them from doing business with Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the inclusion of Lebanon on the Israeli list of enemy states might indicate there is substantial latitude in interpreting the law, given the wide range of international companies that invest in and trade with Lebanese companies and individuals, that also participate in the Israeli economy. Such companies range from those in finance to telecoms to motor vehicles to food and drugs and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, while the Abraham accords will likely deepen trilateral investment opportunities between the UAE, Israel and the US, it may do little to increase trade. The three countries already set up the Abraham Fund in October, with a goal of delivering a fund of $3 billion designed to promote regional economic cooperation. However, there is little that can currently be done to harmonize trade agreements. Even though the US has already signed free trade agreements with Bahrain, Jordan, Morocco, Oman and Israel (the latter way back in 1985), the US and UAE have not been able to conclude negotiations for a similar agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there could be opportunities for the UAE to benefit from the US-Israel FTA by part-manufacturing products in the UAE and finishing them in Israel, the rules of origin clause in the agreement mean that 35 percent of the item&rsquo;s value must be produced in Israel through value-added content, which might prove too great a challenge for most production processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, it has yet to be seen whether the initial flurry in investments and activity in cooperation continues to deepen into a long-term partnership, and in particular whether goals such as reaching $4 billion in trade hold up. There is certainly much political will on both sides and there are also complementarities in trade: Israel imports almost all of its crude oil and could benefit from a further diversity of its supply from a regional exporter, while Israel&rsquo;s high-technology export focus would benefit the UAE&rsquo;s increasingly technological economy and manufacturing base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet as the opening enthusiasm wanes and the wheels of commerce grind, it may take further artful diplomacy and a favorable economic environment to enable the solidification of ties. And for countries with less dynamic, less open and less complementary economies than the UAE &ndash; such as Morocco and Sudan &ndash; the path to greater trade and deep economic ties seems even more of an uphill struggle.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638168071.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'after-the-abraham-accords-will-trade-and-investment-follow', '', '2021-11-29 12:11:11', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(206, 5, 18, 'Is Listing Aramco Really the Best Way for Saudi Arabia to Realize Value in its Energy Industry?', NULL, NULL, '<p>It&rsquo;s a question that has not had a proper airing, at least not in public. But is an initial public offering of shares in Aramco really the best way to accomplish the goals the country is trying to achieve? Could a more sophisticated approach not extract more value for the kingdom and help spur greater dynamism across the company?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The valuation that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has consistently talked about since he broke the news in an interview in 2016 is $2 trillion. But what happens when companies get close to even half that size? There is, inevitably, talk about how much more they would be worth if they were broken into their constituent parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take Alphabet, Google&rsquo;s parent company, whose total market value has been floating around $800 billion this year, putting it up there with Microsoft, Apple and Amazon as the most highly valued publicly traded companies in the world. Even putting to one side the talk about the US government forcibly breaking up Alphabet and some other tech giants on antitrust grounds, there is a good case to be made that the company would be worth a lot more if it voluntarily split itself up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laura Martin, an analyst at the New York investment bank Needham &amp; Co., pointed out in a research note that investors prefer &ldquo;pure play&rdquo; stocks to conglomerates and typically value them more highly. She estimated that Alphabet, broken into three separate companies, would be worth about 50 percent more than it is worth intact. A standalone YouTube, for example, would be worth $200 billion, or 30 percent more than it is worth as part of Alphabet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would this not also apply to Aramco? In trying to sell a stake in a company that would not only be the world&rsquo;s largest publicly traded concern, but twice the size of the next largest, doesn&rsquo;t that inevitably mean giving up a vast amount of value just to achieve that title?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest component of value in Aramco is its vast oil reserves, estimated to be 268 billion barrels, or about 18 percent of the world total. But, for a variety of reasons, the oil reserves have been one of the biggest stumbling blocks in terms of valuing Aramco. For one thing, the Saudi leadership has made it clear that the oil and gas reserves will remain the property of the kingdom, so it is not actually selling an equity stake in those.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, oil companies are not valued on the basis of oil in the ground but on what their production is likely to be over, say, 10 years, and how cheaply they can extract it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to maximize the value of Aramco&rsquo;s upstream business could be to place the value of production in its fledgling trading operation, Aramco Trading Company. Like other Arabian Gulf producers, Aramco has been ultra-conservative in the past about creating trading operations to match those of the international oil majors. But in the past few years, Gulf national oil companies have all taken steps to create the kind of sophisticated operations that would squeeze more dollars out of every barrel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An independent Aramco trading arm that had exclusive access to Aramco&rsquo;s crude oil and downstream products would have an enormous advantage versus other oil companies and commodities traders. It could also help deal with the uncertainty of the kingdom&rsquo;s taxation and royalties on production, as well as complying with Opec quotas, by putting them at arms-length.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, there are obstacles to overcome, like the fact that Aramco sells its crude oil primarily through long-term contracts directly to customers. But that approach is something that many industry experts have urged it to change anyway. If it committed to the project, Saudi leaders could create one of the world&rsquo;s largest and most profitable commodities trading firms, with a valuation that would dwarf the current leaders, such as Glencore valued around $30 billion. Already, with Aramco Trading focused on trading downstream products, the company&rsquo;s stated aim is to become &ldquo;one of the top three trading powerhouses.&rdquo; It just needs to elevate that ambition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other advantages to the break-up approach that meet key goals for the kingdom. A trading company could &ndash; and should, experts argue &ndash; be domiciled outside the kingdom. This would allow the company to be much more transparent and dynamic than Aramco has been traditionally. The scrutiny of a publicly traded Aramco Trading would put it under pressure to perform, and it would be the type of organization that would attract energetic, entrepreneurial Saudis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This break-up could also apply to Aramco&rsquo;s downstream business, where the company already has been pursuing an ambitious global strategy that focuses on petrochemicals, exemplified by the consolidation of Sabic last year. It aims to grow this business to be the world leader in refining and petrochemicals over the next few years. The potential for a separate global downstream operation that also is domiciled outside the kingdom creates some of the same opportunities as the trading arm to boost transparency and dynamism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core question for the leadership is whether it meets the kingdom&rsquo;s ultimate financial goal, even if it doesn&rsquo;t create &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s largest publicly traded company.&rdquo;</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638170131.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'is-listing-aramco-really-the-best-way-for-saudi-arabia-to-realize-value-in-its-energy-industry', '', '2021-11-29 12:45:31', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(207, 5, 18, 'Sovereign Wealth Funds Can Get Venture Capital and Tech Firms Back on Track', NULL, NULL, '<p>Venture capitalism isn&rsquo;t a new idea. But it&rsquo;s only been in the last three decades that its effectiveness has come into sharp focus. The most innovative technology platforms and products of recent times often have been funded by venture-capital firms. The rise of VC has been so profound that some have begun to argue that VC firms essentially are the new central planners. However, unlike governments, VC firms don&rsquo;t operate in the public interest or have to report to anyone except their own shareholders and investors. There have been some spectacular lapses as a consequence of that. It is high time the sector was reformed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how? In fact, is it even possible to regulate &ndash; for that is what &ldquo;reform&rdquo; implies &ndash; a sector that often works outside home jurisdictions? Indeed, the VC sector&rsquo;s effectiveness often is a function of its nimbleness in working across borders, sectors and old-fashioned notions of investment protocols. There is thus a threat of reforming the VC sector to its death &ndash; if you can even come up with a plan. The answer lies in harnessing the complex calculus of risk-taking and financial gains, married to a moral focus, that is found in sovereign wealth funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, the problems. In an article in the New Yorker magazine in November, Charles Duhigg charts the rise of venture capitalism and pulls back the curtain on some uncomfortable truths. He goes through the spectacular rise and decline of the office co-working-space company, WeWork, to highlight the challenges surrounding venture capitalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because they often work in the shadows, VC firms have largely evaded public backlash for enabling reckless behavior. Duhigg begins by quoting the CEO of a WeWork competitor that was essentially put out of business because of seemingly unlimited venture capital flowing to his rival. &ldquo;VCs seem like these quiet, boring guys who are good at math, encourage you to dream big and have private planes. You know who else is quiet, good at math and has private planes? Drug cartels.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WeWork is a prime example of the danger of failure of venture capitalism, if left unchecked. Despite the buccaneering behavior of the company, VC firms kept pouring money into it. Major VC backers stayed quiet while the company engaged in questionable business strategies and plunged the company into serious difficulties. Why did these enablers escape scrutiny for this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer lies in the fact that VC firms and technology companies have largely written their own rules. Technology company CEOs and founders, from Facebook&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg to Uber&rsquo;s Travis Kalanick, have (correctly) been raked over the coals for their dubious business decisions and unchecked power. VC firms have been complicit in enabling this power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Criticism of the VC sector, however, is not meant to undermine the incredible ability of venture capitalism to propel innovation, but rather to address the hiccups that hamper the possibility of even greater success. Criticism, therefore, is meant to avoid any failure in the VC model. The latter point is especially important, because it is critical to the development of the new, tech-driven economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of governments around the world have sovereign wealth funds that function like VC firms. Temasek Holdings in Singapore and Mubadala in Abu Dhabi immediately come to mind. Like VC firms, these funds make strategic investments in emerging sectors and participate in board-level decisions. Their aim is to get in on the ground floor of emerging technological developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But unlike VC firms, many sovereign-wealth investments are predicated on building new industries back home, creating new jobs for their citizens. In this, sovereign wealth funds have a greater &ndash; and moral &ndash; interest in ensuring their money is safely invested in companies that won&rsquo;t implode. Greater participation of sovereign wealth funds in venture capital funding will therefore function to encourage partner investors, like the VC firms, to change their modus operandi in the companies they invest in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond that, sovereign investment funds also have stakes in VC firms themselves. Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Public Investment Fund, or PIF, has a stake in SoftBank&rsquo;s Vision Fund, for example. As does Mubadala from Abu Dhabi. Malaysia&rsquo;s Khazanah Holdings was reported last year to have been in talks over an injection of funds into the Vision Fund. An entrenchment of sovereign wealth fund participation in VC firms could change the character of such firms &ndash; which might prevent another WeWork, in which Softbank has been invested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that aside from the debacle at WeWork, SoftBank did make a very tidy profit off the initial public offering of DoorDash earlier in December. Meanwhile, Sequoia Capital, one of the largest VC firms in Silicon Valley, is poised for an 11-fold return this year, thanks to several early bets on technology companies that have been instrumental in the remote-work pivot caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The caveat, however, is that, as noted earlier, the technology sector operates by its own rules, and it might prove difficult to break its habit. Consider landmark lawsuits filed against Facebook this month in the United States. The lawsuits allege that Facebook bought up rivals and &ldquo;illegally squashed the competition.&rdquo; The only problem is that the regulatory model used to go after Facebook is based on 20th-century notions of monopoly and anti-trust. This highlights the deeper problem of our collective lack of understanding about how the tech sector operates &ndash; and thus how difficult it is to influence behavior for the better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, with their interests backed up by deep pockets, sovereign wealth funds have a chance at breaking norms at both tech and VC firms. It&rsquo;s time to see forward-thinking nations start their own form of &ldquo;disruption.&rdquo;</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638170191.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'sovereign-wealth-funds-can-get-venture-capital-and-tech-firms-back-on-track', '', '2021-11-29 12:46:31', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Earlier this year, the 29-year-old British Muslim posted a 47-minute, non-stop stream of abuse she had received from her &ldquo;followers&rdquo; on social media that showed a frightening degree of hate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outpouring of misogyny and hatred &ndash; from erstwhile fans of the fashion adviser no less &ndash; exposes a breakdown in civil conversation on social media, in which people are indulging their worst tendencies at the expense of normal human relationships. Technology is shaping our societies in ways we barely understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Torkia, a mother of two, has a following of more than 1 million people on Instagram, who are attracted to her tips on modest fashion and hijab styling. But recently, she announced she had decided to remove her hijab because, in her words, &ldquo;the hijabi community [is] starting to become like a toxic cult.&rdquo; If that community wanted to prove her wrong, the avalanche of insults and even death threats had precisely the opposite effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past decade, offensive and generally toxic comments on social media have become the new normal in a public discourse shorn of filters and any sense of decorum. Far too many people seem to feel that their opinions &ndash; on anything and everything &ndash; absolutely must be shared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is entirely Torkia&rsquo;s own decision whether she wears a hijab, and indeed how she wants to live her life. Her social media profile and the attention of so many followers have bestowed upon her a degree of fame, which certainly has boosted her online business. But such attention is a double-edged sword.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media is now associated with a number of health problems, including everything from increased rates of depression and anxiety to extreme isolation. But cyberbullying and trolling belong to a whole different category of pathological behavior, with multiple studies finding a strong correlation between cyberbullying and sadistic personality profiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other research has analyzed online communication factors contributing to the &ldquo;toxic online disinhibition effect,&rdquo; i.e., the loss of inhibition in cyberspace leading to hostile or vulgar language and even threats. Among three factors contributing to the effect &ndash; anonymity, invisibility and the lack of eye contact &ndash; the last was found to be the chief contributor to negative loss of inhibitions. Apparently, people are often much nastier when they do not have to look someone in the face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regionally, research that specifically focused on Saudi higher education found that about 27 percent of students reported they had &ldquo;committed&rdquo; cyberbullying at least once, while 57 percent had &ldquo;observed&rdquo; another student being cyberbullied. Gender was also a factor, with male students involved in cyberbullying more than female students and, interestingly enough, single students more likely to be cyberbullied by people that they knew. The gender bias, of course, comes as little surprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a step back, social media has empowered that character type &ndash; we all know one &ndash; who is always prying into neighbors&rsquo; business and gossiping with anyone who will listen. But whereas we used to have the option of simply closing the door, now the noisy gossip can beam right into our living rooms, often with hurtful consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, the internet panders to our baser instincts, allowing people to attack each other &ndash; in Torkia&rsquo;s case over supposed &ldquo;shameful&rdquo; behavior &ndash; without an ounce of self-reflection. That lack of inhibition is often reinforced by anonymous or fake profiles that shield trolls and bullies from the consequences of their statements. However, when people post &ldquo;I hope you die&rdquo; attacking a woman about her clothing, it is incontrovertible that they are revealing far more about themselves than the targets of their vitriol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also an obvious attention-seeking element in such online behavior. An insult certainly provokes a reaction far quicker than a reasonable argument or engaging in conversation. While the quality of the interactions suggests elements of sadism, trolling and bullying often seem equally to reflect a craving for recognition and validation, even in the form of scorn or revulsion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeking that sort of short-term gratification also suggests profound isolation, in which actual human interactions have been replaced by screen time and bite-sized messaging. The impact of social media spills over into our &ldquo;real life&rdquo; relationships, with substantial research pointing at greater tendencies toward antisocial behavior and dysfunctional communication, with the quality and depth of communication suffering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have all laughed at photos showing couples on dates, group of friends or families gathering around the dinner table, with each person&rsquo;s eyes riveted to their smart phone. Those photos have gone viral on social media precisely because they strike a chord with so many. Smart-phone penetration in most countries is skyrocketing with typical users checking their devices every 10 to 12 minutes. That picture of a group of friends sitting together, looking only at their phones, is compelling because we recognize the resemblance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, that does not mean everyone is a troll telling people to die, but in some ways social media is prying us apart, not building communities as its advocates say, but actually replacing interactions that are needed for a healthy social life.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638170245.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'our-problem-with-social-media', '', '2021-11-29 12:47:25', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

But when the world&rsquo;s biggest oil producer this month offered a tantalizing glimpse behind the veil of secrecy that normally conceals its activities, it may also have raised the curtain on the last act of the fossil fuels era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been three years since Saudi Aramco first announced it was planning to go public. Since then, the plan has been on and off again several times, but now it seems to be back on again. If, as Saudi energy minister Khalid Al Falih has suggested, Aramco shares are floated on the market at some point in the next year and a half, it promises to be the largest initial public offering ever seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This company, owned outright by the Saudi government, is gigantic. In 2018 it made a net profit of $111.1 billion, making it almost twice as big as Apple, the world&rsquo;s most profitable publicly quoted company, and dwarfing the profitability of each of the other major oil companies. On August 12, the company revealed its income for the first half of 2019 had fallen by 12 percent to $47 billion, a drop blamed on a dip in the price of crude, but Aramco remains easily the world&rsquo;s most profitable company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why, then, is Saudi Arabia looking to offer outsiders a slice of the action?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most plausible explanation is that, 86 years after Saudi Arabia signed the concession agreement with a US oil company that led to the creation of the Arabia American Oil Company and 39 years since the government increased its stake in Aramco to 100 percent, it realizes that sunset for fossil fuel is just over the horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On one level, this is terrific news for a planet facing irreversible harm from the impact of fossil-fuel consumption. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer of crude oil in the world and analysts believe it plans to use the billions, if not trillions, of dollars an IPO would yield partly to finance ambitious plans to wean the country off dependence upon oil and to develop a significant renewable-energy sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a planned IPO signals that all that Saudi oil is not likely to be staying in the ground. Quite how much oil Saudi Arabia is sitting on has always been uncertain. But in January, in a move to improve transparency before offering shares, Aramco released details of the first independent audit of the country&rsquo;s oil reserves. It confirmed that, with 263.1 billion untapped barrels at the end of 2017, Saudi Arabia has the world&rsquo;s largest reserves of crude. Similarly, the company&rsquo;s first and massively oversubscribed international bond issue three months later, which raised $12 billion, was designed to test the appetite and pave the way for an IPO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Objective achieved. Global investors are raring to go and when shares do finally go on sale, there will doubtless be an unrestrained feeding frenzy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, none of these potential investors is unaware of the growing environmental pressure on oil and the simultaneous growth in interest and investment in renewable energy sources, which together limit Aramco&rsquo;s long-term prospects. But they also know there is still a short-term fortune to be made from oil and gas and they will be ruthless in their determination to squeeze every possible cent of profit from every drop before the curtain finally falls on the fossil-fuel era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of all of that, this is a pivotal moment in the global switch from fossil fuels to alternative sources of energy. It signals Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s recognition that oil is dying and that it is better to reap a huge dividend from the sale of that asset now rather than watch income steadily diminish until the stock is worthless. It is also likely to stimulate similar strategic thinking among Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s oil-producing neighbors, who may well accelerate their own efforts to simultaneously maximize profits and reduce reliance upon oil in favor of going all-out to develop significant renewables sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is no coincidence, then, that Saudi Arabia has just invited bids for a series of massive solar-energy projects as it starts to ramp up its commitment to renewable-energy targets outlined under the country&rsquo;s Vision 2030 plan. Although it is falling in price, solar infrastructure, remains expensive and vast investment is required &ndash; investment that could easily be funded by an IPO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be an exaggeration to suggest that Saudi Arabia is prematurely turning its back on oil; profits from that bounty will continue to flow into the nation&rsquo;s coffers for many years to come. But the fact that it is reducing its exposure to reliance on the commodity in such a public way and is happy to share the remaining short-term benefits with outside investors indicates that the kingdom recognizes that the end of an era is looming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equally significant, this historic development suggests another, optimistic scenario. For the sun-drenched region as a whole, the global transition to renewable energy and especially to solar power is not only inevitable but something to be welcomed with open arms as the next great bonanza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protectionist tariff barriers that have impeded the widespread adoption of renewable energy around the world will inevitably fall under the weight of their own ultimately indefensible illogicality, while the cost of solar and other renewables is constantly falling as technologies improve. A paper in the journal Nature this month, for example, revealed that 344 cities in China are already producing unsubsidized solar-generated electricity at or below the price of conventionally generated energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the response from the oil-rich states of the Gulf must be imaginative. Maximum effort must now be directed into developing the cutting-edge technologies necessary to ensure that solar power can not only be harnessed efficiently at home, but can also be stored, distributed and exported as efficiently as oil has been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be a massive, daunting enterprise, demanding huge investment and paradigm-shifting technological breakthroughs, but it will be more than worth it. As they were once blessed with oil, so the Gulf states are blessed with sunshine, a natural and endlessly renewable asset that, with the right investment in ingenuity, can be commoditized in perpetuity &ndash; and save the Earth into the bargain.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638170313.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'as-the-sun-sets-on-oil-the-sun-will-rise-on-solar-power', '', '2021-11-29 12:48:33', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Last year, the company made $111 billion in profit, and the price eventually set for its initial public offering could value the company at as much as $1.7 trillion. The Aramco IPO is critical to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&rsquo;s plans to modernize his country&rsquo;s economy with a raft of initiatives, including the creation of a new &ldquo;future&rdquo; city in the Saudi desert, along with investments into future industries essential for the creation of a knowledge-based economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lead up to what will be the world&rsquo;s biggest ever IPO has shone a spotlight on the company&rsquo;s place in the global economy &ndash; not because of how much money it makes but because of who is interested in investing and why. Could foreign investors use Aramco to initiate major changes to the global currency system? The Chinese appear to think so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just before the IPO announcement, it was reported that China was considering acquiring a major stake in the company. Chinese state-owned entities led by the Beijing-based Silk Road Fund were in talks to invest $5 billion to $10 billion in the IPO. Prince Mohammed has always been open about wanting to attract major foreign stakes in Aramco. But China&rsquo;s involvement in Aramco is fraught with its own complex geopolitical undertones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long before Donald Trump came to power and began a trade war with Beijing, China was making noises about challenging the dollar&rsquo;s dominance as the world&rsquo;s universal currency. This would give China more control over its own economy and help with long-term economic projects designed to challenge the US as the world&rsquo;s sole economic superpower. But unseating the dollar is much easier said than done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through infrastructure projects across the emerging world, China is extending its economic influence in a way that repositions global trade flows away from the West and into China. The ambitious Belt and Road initiative, for example, is underpinned by several Chinese financial institutions like the Silk Road Fund, which extend credit to entities in Africa to Central Asia. Some of this money goes into infrastructure projects often carried out by Chinese companies, which inevitably leads to some poorer countries becoming trapped in debt to Beijing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aramco public offering gives China an opportunity to gain a foothold at the center of the global oil industry. Oil is arguably the most important commodity traded in dollars and disrupting the barrel-to-dollar peg could have profound consequences for China&rsquo;s plans to join (or replace) the dollar as the global trading currency. A Chinese stake in the world&rsquo;s largest oil company, therefore, would give Beijing power to influence how the commodity is traded. Meanwhile, the Chinese can also quietly position themselves as possible financiers of the Saudi crown prince&rsquo;s transformation plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s be clear: the renminbi is not about to replace the dollar as the global trading currency. Nor is Saudi Arabia likely to risk a major confrontation with its most important ally, the United States, and agree to Chinese demands for the renminbi to become the oil market&rsquo;s trading currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, when it comes to global currency reserves held by central banks, the dollar is king. According to the IMF, in 2017 the Chinese renminbi made up only a tiny amount of allocated foreign exchange reserves, whereas the Financial Times reports that more than 60 percent of global currency reserves are held in dollars. And despite China overtaking the US in gross crude oil imports in 2017, Beijing has not managed to persuade major oil-producing nations to take that crucial step toward transforming the oil trade and abandon trading in dollar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But cracks are starting to appear. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia threatened to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if the United States passed legislation that would expose OPEC member states to American antitrust laws. Never before had Riyadh reacted so dramatically. The bill never came into force, but if Saudi Arabia ditched the dollar, its position as the world&rsquo;s primary trading and reserve currency would be seriously undermined and would reduce America&rsquo;s economic power in global trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is also playing a long game. Through various investments across the Gulf, the Chinese have been primarily interested in securing their own access to oil. With the ongoing US-China trade war, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely Beijing would risk any serious escalation with Washington by using China&rsquo;s clout to change the status quo and push for a change in oil trading in the Arabian Gulf. But China has made it clear that it wants the renminbi to be a global trading currency and is strengthening relationships with oil-producing nations from the Arabian Gulf to Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The intention is clear: Beijing wants to push for change and is only waiting for the right time. And as much as the Chinese might want to use the Aramco IPO to effect this, the reality is that it won&rsquo;t work out this way. Nevertheless, when the moment does actually come, China will be sure to be ready.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638170357.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'chinas-growing-interest-in-saudi-aramco-is-part-of-a-long-game', '', '2021-11-29 12:49:17', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(211, 5, 19, '‘Sustainable’ and ‘Development’ May Not Be Compatible; Something Needs to Be Done About It', NULL, NULL, '<p>Last month, the European aerospace company, Airbus, predicted that over the next 20 years the number of commercial aircraft in operation around the world would double. Executives brushed off fears about the impact on climate change by insisting that the company was &ldquo;a champion of bringing global emissions down.&rdquo; Since 1990, technological advances have indeed cut aircraft fuel consumption per passenger kilometer by half. But at the same time the number of passenger flights quadrupled, to 4.2 billion a year, utterly nullifying any gains in efficiency. By 2037 there will be more than 8 billion flights a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day after the Airbus announcement, a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation revealed that between 2013 and 2018 the volume of carbon dioxide emitted by airlines increased by 32 percent. The figure is 70 percent worse than predicted by the UN and equivalent to firing up 50 new coal-burning power plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was bad enough that Airbus presented a misleading picture of the aviation industry&rsquo;s inability to match its exponential expansion with parallel improvements in fuel efficiency. But then Bob Lange, a senior vice-president at the company, had the audacity to present the disastrous projected explosion of air travel as a noble exercise in human rights. The growth, he said, was &ldquo;largely coming from people who haven&rsquo;t accessed air travel in the past [and] in the notion of what we&rsquo;re going to do to protect our planet there has to be a notion of equity.&rdquo; The greatest demand for air travel will come from the rising middle classes in the developing world. Indeed, said Lange, even if US consumers halved their travel (which of course they won&rsquo;t) &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not going to make a dent in [the numbers of] people travelling for the first time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to paraphrase the message from Airbus to the upwardly mobile of the developing world: &ldquo;We in the developed world have driven the planet to the brink. Now it&rsquo;s only fair that you should have the chance to emulate our profligacy and tip it over the edge.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Air travel is not the only threat to life on earth, but it is a useful barometer of how runaway economic growth and development, if allowed to continue unmitigated, will irreparably harm the planet. The dilemma in which the world finds itself is summed up by two words: &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; and &ldquo;development.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given our current inability to slow global warming, those words have no business being in the same sentence. And yet, in the UN&rsquo;s headline Sustainable Development Goals program, there they are, sitting incongruously side by side. To really appreciate the contradictory nature of the Sustainable Development Goals, it pays first to examine the impact of the UN&rsquo;s predecessor program, the Millennium Development Goals, which ran from 2000 to 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were eight goals. They included eradicating hunger and poverty, reducing child mortality, achieving universal primary education, combatting deadly diseases such as HIV/Aids and malaria and promoting gender equality. In its end-of-term report in 2015, the UN celebrated the &ldquo;profound achievements&rdquo; that had been made in just about all these areas, but one headline result stood out. The number of people in the middle class &ndash; that growing, aspirant army of future airline-industry customers &ndash; had almost tripled between 1990 and 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flipside of that achievement was the significant downside of the Millennium Development Goals. Only one of the goals addressed environmental sustainability and here there was less to celebrate, including a 50 percent increase in global carbon dioxide emissions, the loss of millions of hectares of forests, drastic overexploitation of fish stocks and increasing water scarcity, which by 2015 was affecting 40 percent of people and is certain to increase as global development proceeds unchecked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast-forward to the 15-year Sustainable Development Goals program, launched in 2015 with an even more ambitious collection of 17 targets. This time the buzzword is &ldquo;integration,&rdquo; a principle introduced in recognition of the reality that &ldquo;action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s lacking, however, is any concrete guidance on how a continuous raising of living standards across the developing world can be achieved without delivering a fatal blow to our already half-hearted efforts to avoid environmental catastrophe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something, clearly, must be done to synchronize the goals of development and sustainability. No one can argue against the morality of reducing childhood mortality rates and lifting billions out of poverty. It is truly a very good thing, indeed. But doing so without simultaneously reducing our per capita reliance on fossil fuels is a recipe for disaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005 demographers at the London School of Economics calculated that even a 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide production in developed countries by 2050 would be cancelled out by population growth in the developing world &ndash; and the UN estimates that by 2050 the world&rsquo;s population will have increased from about 7 billion today to close to 10 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the signs are everywhere that we are losing control of global warming. Just last month, the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that while global sea levels rose by about 15 cm during the whole of the 20th century, they are now rising twice as fast, at a rate of 3.6 mm a year. Debra Roberts, co-chair of the IPCC working group, warned that the choices we make now are critical for our future. Global warming, she said, can be held in check only with &ldquo;unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society, including energy, land and ecosystems, infrastructure [and] industry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all our sakes, including the emerging middle classes in the developing world, who clearly deserve uplifts in their living standards to those of the developed world, we must hope that someone, somewhere, is listening. If they aren&rsquo;t, then the world those new travelers are poised to visit in those fleets of shiny new aircraft simply won&rsquo;t be worth having.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638170485.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'sustainable-and-development-may-not-be-compatible-something-needs-to-be-done-about-it', '', '2021-11-29 12:51:25', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(212, 5, 19, 'How the Financial Market Can Help Stop Climate Change', NULL, NULL, '<p>In early December, water futures became a tradeable commodity on Wall Street. Investors now can bet on the availability of water in California, one of the most important agricultural markets in the world. The emergence of this futures market is a signal of real scarcity for one of the planet&rsquo;s most precious natural resources. Yet, there is a silver lining. Like the futures market for gold and oil, if water becomes even scarcer, its price goes up. This creates a quantifiable tool for the cost understanding of water scarcity, which encourages conservation and investment in water-saving technology. Now, imagine if a market mechanism was extended to other pressing challenges like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/climate-change-nuclear-energy/\">carbon emissions</a>&nbsp;that cause climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it&rsquo;s already happening. However, there are several key differences: water is getting scarcer; carbon emissions are increasing. And for carbon emissions, there are at least two steps necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first part, look at the global payment processing company Stripe. In 2019, it committed to spend $1 million to buy credit from a number of companies for future carbon removal from the atmosphere and sequestration of this in long-term storage. In October, the company invited businesses that use its software to directly support carbon removal by committing a portion of their revenue to the project (it launches for US businesses first).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is this important? The Paris Agreement on climate change has set its goal to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. To reach that target, the international community needs double-digit decarbonization. That&rsquo;s a big ask. Heavy investment is needed to enable this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how? Consider how Stripe&rsquo;s actions could trigger reductions in the price of carbon-capture. By paying carbon-removal companies now for future carbon sequestration, it is investing in these companies and their technology. And then by asking its customers to join it, Stripe is creating a demand-side market for the technology. Wright&rsquo;s Law, used for forecasting prices, says that increasing volumes lead to learning effects and rapidly decreasing prices. Stripe is triggering this effect by being a buyer of first resort. Its actions will push carbon-capture prices to decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This concept is visible in the rise of electric vehicles and the cost of the batteries that power them. In little over a decade, the cost of lithium-ion batteries has dropped nearly 85 percent. Electric vehicles now have become cheap enough to compete with traditional fossil-fuel cars, and the cost keeps going down as the market opens up. This is partially due to innovative efforts by companies like Tesla that got into the market early. Apple&rsquo;s recent announcement that it will design and sell an electric car in 2024 will expand the market even further and drive costs lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Stripe won&rsquo;t make money out of its carbon purchase. If anything, it is paying a higher price now for what should be cheaper in the future. Still, anti-climate-change advocates like Stripe should be rewarded for their moral risk-taking. Particularly if we want them to help make anti-climate-change technology viable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here&rsquo;s the next part. What if financial markets were to create a trading instrument that is inverse to the mechanism of the California water (or gold or oil) futures? Essentially, this would be a derivative instrument based on the future spot price of carbon removal. Carbon credits bought up to a certain date could be priced according to the inverse of spot prices &ndash; like bond prices go up when interest rates go down. And like bonds, there could be a series of future tranches of carbon bought at specific, set dates so the market is sustainable. The details can be left to Wall Street, but the possibility certainly is there to reward those who take a position now on our future good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is morally wrong for the developed world to tell developing economies that they must reduce their greenhouse emissions now after the West has done more than its fair share of polluting the Earth in the past. Carbon sequestration can remove the excess greenhouse gases, if we invest in the technology. Yet the leading economies of the world have, for various reasons, refused to embrace the principle of Wright&rsquo;s Law for meaningful climate impact. The private sector has picked up the slack though, as is clear with the stunning rise in the electric-vehicle sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Stripe might be a small company, its approach is one that smaller, more nimble countries could easily adapt. Tech-focused countries like Estonia and Singapore, for example. In addition, major hydrocarbon-producing countries such as those in the Gulf might see the logic of investing in carbon removal as the opposite complement to their fossil-fuel industry, profiting eventually through the financial markets.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638171221.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'how-the-financial-market-can-help-stop-climate-change', '', '2021-11-29 13:03:41', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(213, 5, 19, 'Britain’s Ban on Hezbollah: Why Now?', NULL, NULL, '<p>The oddest feature of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s recent decision to censure the entirety of Lebanon&rsquo;s Hezbollah as a terrorist group is that it hadn&rsquo;t happened before. The second-oddest feature is that it is happening at this time. Trying to rationalize the timing has sent Middle East watchers into a tizzy of speculation, ranging from a suggestion of parochial political grandstanding, tinged with posturing against Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour party, on the part of the home secretary, Sajid Javid, to more ominous signals emanating from exasperated intelligence service officials who say there&rsquo;s no sense in talking to the Iranians, who ultimately control Hezbollah, and that matters are heading to a regional confrontation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For two years those British spies were cultivating whoever might provide a back channel to Iran&rsquo;s rising Caesar, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who also happens to be Hezbollah&rsquo;s benefactor and overseer. That much was transparent from the political vantage point of Baghdad, where word had it that the recapture of Kirkuk in October 2017 from the Kurds was borne out, in part, of a practical understanding between Soleimani and the British. But whereas the Iranian general garnered political and strategic capital with that stunt, Britain&rsquo;s advantage seemed mundanely mercantile, with the oil company BP assuming operating control of some of the worthier wells of the province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herein lies a bifurcation as to how many in the Middle East understand Britain&rsquo;s role. One former US official with business dealings in the region gets incensed when his contacts in the region ask him, &ldquo;Yes, but what do the Brits think?&rdquo; He lashes out by telling them that Britain no longer has an army to speak of and it is as geopolitically relevant to the region as the Netherlands is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is exaggerating, but not by much. In many ways it does seem as if British foreign policy has regressed into the modalities of the first couple of centuries of the East India Company: mercantilism above grand strategy; mercenary in practice, opportunistic in outlook, transient in relevance. However, the glow of a faded empire still commands some respect in the lands once impacted by it, and many in the Middle East cannot bring themselves to write-off the British so casually as that American businessman demands they do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the top dog is still the US, and even those who put stock in what the British may have to say continue to understand the transatlantic relationship as complementary, with the UK following America&rsquo;s lead. And if the US president is embarking on a foreign policy where everything is a transaction, then so go the British, or as one Lebanese wit drolly put it to me: &ldquo;Britain is America&rsquo;s retweet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, it would be far easier to conclude, as many do, that since Washington has decided on a plan of &ldquo;maximum pressure&rdquo; on Iran, then London can show good faith, or at least better faith than that exhibited by the French and Germans, by banning Hezbollah&rsquo;s political wing, which essentially means that waving its green on yellow flag during Al Quds Day parades under Britain&rsquo;s grey skies may land one in jail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a small gesture, costing Britain little, but one that can be leveraged for better coordination with the Americans on a host of other issues. Some analysts go further by suggesting that the British may have spotted a trend whereby Hezbollah seeks to become more moderate, going so far as to gradually dissociate itself from the Iranians, thus hoping to ride out the storm of Donald Trump&rsquo;s furies. Britain&rsquo;s pressing of the Lebanese would drive home that &ldquo;break,&rdquo; or so the thinking goes. Other analysts take their insights further into the weeds, citing some imminent yet opaque movements on the Yemen and Bahrain fronts that may have influenced the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources tell me that Hezbollah was caught off guard by the decision even though they were aware that it had been a matter of debate for some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An overt, legal presence in London was about more than flags and parades for its leaders. Much of the wealth generated by &eacute;migr&eacute; Lebanese Shiite communities in West Africa sloshes through British banks, and this provided an important revenue stream for Hezbollah&rsquo;s coffers, as well as masking its own means of shunting money around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, London had been a sanctuary for Shiite Islamist dissident groups since the 1980s, and some of those groups, such as the Iraqi Da&rsquo;awa party, had leveraged that presence into a deep alliance with Britain&rsquo;s intelligence community, to the advantage of both sides, especially with the former garnering the highest executive offices in Baghdad since 2003. Hezbollah had hoped to anchor a similarly beneficial relationship in British waters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the British lose by booting out Hezbollah is access to channels that proved useful during the Syrian war, ranging from sharing information about foreign fighters, to extraction operations for kidnapped British nationals. The most important of the Hezbollah-approved channels ran through Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, head of Lebanon&rsquo;s General Directorate for General Security. Another channel allegedly had Hezbollah and the British meeting face-to-face in out-of-the-way Bucharest. But as the Syrian war peters out, and given that the British never had exclusivity in such relationships, having to share access with other Europeans, the value of such channels had dropped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, seeking to break off Hezbollah from Iran is a delusion. Gesturing toward the Americans is likewise unnecessary, since the British do not need to do much to look better than the Europeans in Washington&rsquo;s eyes. Very little of the explanations proffered above help us in understanding the timing. Which leaves the one we cannot see: why pull the plug on a two-year charm campaign that had been directed at Soleimani?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be that British intelligence saw what Iran&rsquo;s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, had seen right before foppishly tendering his resignation: the balance of Tehran&rsquo;s regional strategy going forward is leaning to Soleimani&rsquo;s favor, and Soleimani is more interested in confrontation than in talking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, sanctioning Hezbollah may echo Zarif&rsquo;s theatric affectations. It communicates displeasure, but not much more. It also tells us that the spooks may be in the dark as to what Soleimani has in store.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638171285.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'britains-ban-on-hezbollah-why-now', '', '2021-11-29 13:04:45', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Indeed, to the outside world, almost no other country in the Middle East appears to be as technologically savvy. Tiny Israel has an outsized tech sector that has been very successful in creating products and platforms that it has successfully sold to the West and to Asia. But the truth is, Israel isn&rsquo;t the exclusive locus of innovation in the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reminder of that came last month. Ahead of its stock listing in New York, the ride-sharing juggernaut Uber bought Dubai-based rival Careem for $3.1 billion. This was the largest technology sector transaction in the Middle East since Amazon&rsquo;s 2017 acquisition of another Dubai-based company, the online retailer&nbsp;<a href=\"http://souq.com/\">Souq.com</a>, for $580 million. In fact, those deals were the largest tech acquisitions in the history of the region; acquisitions of Israeli startups don&rsquo;t even come close in size or scope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Uber deal with Careem, in particular, demonstrates how Dubai&rsquo;s substantial investment of resources and effort into the startup ecosystem is paying dividends. The message is this: If you are an entrepreneur keen on building a regional company or operating in emerging markets in Africa or South Asia, Dubai is a natural place to set up shop. With its advanced infrastructure and close proximity to major population centers across key emerging markets, the city is fast becoming a powerhouse on the global tech map.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to overstate how critical Dubai&rsquo;s access to points in emerging markets has been and will continue to be. Global GDP growth is shifting away from the West to emerging markets in Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. Dubai is at the center of this movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, these new markets are producing millions of new customers for new products, thanks to the internet and to smartphones. The rise in cashless payments in India and several African countries is one of many examples of how smartphones are creating a new cohort of consumers hitherto confined to an archaic trading system. Smartphones have untapped spending power in a way that has leap-frogged over any possible organic evolution of traditional bricks-and-mortar commercial models. And technologically, Dubai sits in the middle of this as well, having pulled tech service companies into its orbit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With advanced infrastructure in place and a relaxed tax regime, it is an inviting place for startups to set up and benefit from the diversity of the country&rsquo;s talent pool. The public sector also supports the development of the technology scene. Indeed, another piece of news this month underlines the success of the public and private partnership on tech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Annual Investment Meeting in Dubai, fresh data about technology investment revealed the city&rsquo;s leading global position. Between 2015 and 2018, Dubai attracted more than $21 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) for artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics &ndash; ranking it among the highest in the world in attracting FDI for such projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, the UAE government has been proactive in incorporating technologies such as AI and blockchain into day-to-day operations, in areas from water management to education. Like the strategy of similarly small tech-focused economies such as Singapore and Estonia, the UAE&rsquo;s approach is to lead by example at the government level, in order to encourage the private sector. It works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But some caveats and warnings are necessary if the growth of the tech private sector is not to be depressed by, for example, overzealous officials of the old school or policy administrators with protectionist instincts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Dubai and in Abu Dhabi, many government regulators remain stuck with outdated notions of competition. As in, they would rather not have it. This is clear in the continued blocking by the telecommunications regulators of voice-over-internet protocols such as Skype and WhatsApp calling. Instead of fostering a new environment of competition, the bureaucrats have tried to stamp out disruptive technologies. Eventually, however, more open minds must prevail and convince the herd that blocking the progress of technology will only hurt the country&rsquo;s knowledge economy and that having come this far is no guarantee of continued success if structural impediments are not removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent downfall of Abraaj, based in Dubai and once the region&rsquo;s largest private equity hedge fund, is further evidence that the UAE&rsquo;s regulatory environment needs maturation. To be sure, Abraaj used Dubai&rsquo;s position in the world of emerging markets to promote a new form of impact investing, but ran into hurdles getting critical health care projects in Africa and Pakistan to turn a profit. Emerging markets are still tough places to do business despite all the promise they hold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent acquisitions of Careem and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://souq.com/\">Souq.com</a>, and FDI data, show that technology is alive and well and prospering in the Emirates. Now, it needs the regulatory freedom to explore the true outer boundaries of possibility.

By this logic, Azerbaijan, an oil and gas producer that has been assiduously cultivating strong relations with both the US and Israel, would be a prime target. However, Baku has managed to sidestep this possibility with a delicate diplomatic balancing act in its relations with the US, Israel and Iran. Nonetheless, as tensions between those three countries escalate, Azerbaijan may be compelled take sides and might become a new site for conflict between Iran and the US-Israel alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Azerbaijan&rsquo;s post-independence security imperatives have led it to embrace strict secularism at home and a pro-Western orientation in its foreign policy. With its arch-foe Armenia allied to Iran and Russia, Azerbaijan chose to pursue close defense relationships with Turkey, NATO and Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, Azerbaijan&rsquo;s president, Ilham Aliyev, announced the purchase of $5 billion worth of Israeli defense equipment, including drones, missiles and boats. Today, Azerbaijan is the third-largest customer for Israel&rsquo;s military exports, while Israel is the second-largest customer for Azerbaijan&rsquo;s oil. An Israeli company has reportedly even constructed an underground command-and-control center for Azerbaijani intelligence in Baku.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In return, Israeli intelligence was allegedly given access to Azerbaijani air bases to keep tabs on Iran, although the Azerbaijani authorities have denied this vehemently. If Israel were to attack Iran, Israeli jets could land at the Azerbaijani bases instead of having to refuel mid-air and return to Israel. Both countries remain circumspect about the exact nature and depth of their ties. However, a leaked US State Department memo quoted President Aliyev as comparing his country&rsquo;s relations with Israel to an iceberg: &ldquo;nine-tenths of it is below the surface.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Azerbaijan&rsquo;s relations with Iran, in particular, were fraught throughout the 1990s and 2000s, with Iranian political leaders either making revanchist claims to Azerbaijani territory or calling for Azerbaijanis, the majority of whom are Shia, to overthrow their secular government and adopt Iran&rsquo;s political model instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, politicians in Azerbaijan urged ethnic Azeris living in northwest Iran to secede from Iran and join their ethnic cousins in the north. Iran and Azerbaijan came dangerously close to a military conflict in the Caspian Sea in 2009 over their disputed maritime borders. As recently as 2011, an Iranian major-general publicly castigated Azerbaijan for turning itself into an Israeli outpost and made veiled threats about fomenting instability within the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, however, and with the coming to power of President Hassan Rouhani in Iran in 2013, relations between Azerbaijan and Iran have markedly improved. Iranian companies are massive investors in Azerbaijan, while Iranians and Azerbaijanis are among the top visitors to each other&rsquo;s countries. Both have also successfully fixed their maritime border in the Caspian Sea (although this has yet to be ratified by Tehran), which is reassuring to any international oil and gas company keen to invest in Azerbaijan&rsquo;s offshore energy industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, this could unravel rather quickly if Tehran begins to view Azerbaijan not as a neutral neighbor, but rather as an Israeli surrogate in the Caucasus. For the Iranians, the picture looks disquieting. Azerbaijan&rsquo;s military chief visited Israel in October 2018 to strengthen defense ties between both countries. Moreover, recent reports of Israel spying ion Iranian nuclear facilities using spy drones launched from bases in Azerbaijan will surely have set alarm bells ringing in Tehran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Iran were to become convinced that Azerbaijan has dropped its balancing act, it has a whole range of strategic tools at its disposal to not only stir up trouble within Azerbaijan but also to upset global energy markets and effect broader geopolitical ramifications. The Azerbaijani government routinely grapples with militant opposition, chiefly from Shia groups that are ideologically aligned with Iran. For its part, Iran could intervene on behalf of its disaffected co-religionists in Azerbaijan, as it previously did in the 1990s. Indeed, Iran&rsquo;s strategy of proxy warfare &ndash; financing and training local militias in the Middle East &ndash; could very well be replicated across the Caucasus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the starting point of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, Azerbaijan is key to America&rsquo;s plans to wean Europe off its dependence on Russian energy exports. Iranian-sponsored attacks on Azerbaijan&rsquo;s energy infrastructure, whether in the Caspian or on oil and gas pipelines traversing unstable southern regions of Georgia, could severely compromise these plans and end up benefiting Russia. In any case, Russia and Iran both remain implacably opposed to energy infrastructure investments around the Caspian Sea that circumvent their territories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is worth noting that Iran is the only country that has still not ratified the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea (CLSCS), signed last year by states with Caspian Sea shorelines to demarcate their respective maritime borders. This may be Tehran&rsquo;s strategy of forever keeping Azerbaijan&rsquo;s economy and maritime security dependent on Iran&rsquo;s sufferance, so long as Baku retains close ties with Tel Aviv.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last two years, the US has quietly given Baku more than $100 million in military aid to boost its maritime defenses.

But regulators already have their doubts and some have threatened an outright ban of the digital currency before it even gets off the ground. For all the hype and misinformation about what exactly Libra is and how it fits into Facebook&rsquo;s long-term business strategy, the news has focused attention on a market ripe for disruption. The global remittance market is stuck in the last century and Facebook&rsquo;s leadership has identified untapped potential. But can a social media company really improve the lives of the global poor? For countries such as those in the Gulf, where hundreds of thousands of foreign workers send money home each month, this is a key question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The global remittance market hit an all-time high in 2018. The World Bank estimates that annual remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries reached $529 billion in 2018, an increase of 9.6 percent over the previous record high of $483 billion in 2017. The bulk of these remittances are subject to exorbitant transfer fees and use ancient technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the explosion of cheap smartphones and growing internet coverage in the developing world, an entirely new class of customers &ndash; let&rsquo;s call them the global poor &ndash; have entered the market. This is particularly noticeable across Africa, where poorer Africans now have access to WhatsApp and digital payment services that have transformed communication, shopping and how people are able to secure money while planning for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This development has also transformed how the remittance service functions. In South Africa, for example, digital applications proliferate for Zimbabwean migrant workers. Sending money home was once subject to levies as high as 18 percent and cash is an insecure way of storing value. With digital options, levies hover around 5 percent and the money is not as easy to steal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust is the most important component of the remittance trade, as people want to ensure their money will arrive securely at its destination. Despite recent controversies over its handling of user data, Facebook is widely trusted in emerging markets. Through communication applications such as WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in 2014, the social media giant is a daily fixture of our lives. So, if you trust WhatsApp or Instagram (another Facebook-owned application with more than a billion users), why not Libra?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Facebook might have found a market ripe for a good shake-up, rolling out Libra is going to be anything but easy. Regulators around the world have expressed fears about Facebook controlling what could be one of the world&rsquo;s largest currencies. There is also the problem of bank accounts in many key markets. According to Facebook&rsquo;s own research, half of all adults in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan don&rsquo;t have bank accounts. Getting these people into formal financial services is going to be an enormous challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital payment services in Africa have found ways around the bank account issue by relying on field agents to receive cash for transfers, but it is unlikely that Facebook will be able to operate an international team of agents to help users move their Libra around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there is the issue of cryptocurrency. While Facebook refers to Libra as a cryptocurrency (it is built on a blockchain, after all), the &ldquo;coin&rdquo; is certainly not the next Bitcoin. While the code is open source, it is not a blockchain requiring no permission, like Bitcoin. Instead, it will be managed by a handful of major companies, including Uber and Spotify, from a base in Switzerland. Facebook clearly wants to build on the hype of cryptocurrencies, but that might end up hurting Libra&rsquo;s prospects in key markets. In India, Pakistan, China and Bangladesh, cryptocurrencies either are illegal or in the process of being banned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of whether Libra is a success, Facebook has revealed the untapped potential of the remittance market. The social media company is banking on its trust profile and global footprint to bring in users and retain them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Facebook is not the only potential player in this new market. With its reliance on foreign labor, the UAE has long had a major stake in the international remittance trade. Home to people of roughly 200 nationalities, the country has an established and trusted remittance sector. As the capital of the emerging world, where the new global middle class converges for travel, trade and commerce, Dubai is perfectly suited to further disrupt the remittance market. Not only can local venture capitalists invest in payment solutions throughout the developing world, but the country can also leverage its trusted name to back a similar type of product to Libra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libra should be a wake-up call for technology companies and governments in the Middle East. With the right digital innovation, like a government-backed blockchain specifically designed for remittances, the UAE, for one, could command one of the most lucrative and overlooked spaces in the global economy.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638171465.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'the-gulf-is-ideally-placed-to-steal-facebooks-thunder-and-dominate-the-remittance-market', '', '2021-11-29 13:07:45', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(217, 5, 37, 'Aid Has Not Lifted Africa Out of Poverty, But Technology Will', NULL, NULL, '<p>Africa has the world&rsquo;s lowest share of people using the internet, because of poor infrastructure and the rural nature of many communities. This stark statistic is often cited by Western aid agencies to justify investment in rural communities. The problem facing Africa, so the thinking goes, is fundamentally a rural one. While this might be true for the present, Africa&rsquo;s challenges are on the verge of becoming decidedly urban. The future is not rural, it&rsquo;s urban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Western perception of Africa centers on the trajectory of development in other parts of the world, on the presumption that the arc of development in North America, Europe and Asia should and would be replicated in Africa. Today, even with the utter failure of what the consensus says is the right economic plan for the continent, the West persists in its refusal to accept that models from elsewhere don&rsquo;t necessarily work in Africa. For example, Africa has overturned the notion that consumption cannot take off as a major driver of GDP unless a certain proportion of the population has a bank account. How? Because there is technology available at this particular point in Africa&rsquo;s development that did not exist when other parts of the world were at the same juncture. Africa is &ldquo;disrupting&rdquo; the old model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although many may think of Africa as technologically poor, it is in fact tech that has helped raise its wealth quotient in the past decade and it will be technology that will help grow Africa&rsquo;s middle class in the next generation or so. But it will, of course, need help &ndash; and of the right kind, not aid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where statistics about internet penetration and smartphone usage are key for charting the future of the continent. While Africa&rsquo;s share of the internet might be low right now, the continent is one of the fastest-growing internet markets in the world. With overwhelmingly young populations whose numbers are expected to soar, the cities of Africa are about to explode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Bank says urbanization is the most important transformation taking place in Africa, with more than 450 million new city residents expected by 2040. Bloomberg estimates Africa will be home to more than nine megacities with populations of more than 10 million each by 2050. These cities are far beyond the established metropolis of Cairo, Lagos and Johannesburg. N&rsquo;Djamena in Chad, and Antananarivo, capital of Madagascar, are just two examples of soon-to-be megacities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This shift brings enormous opportunity for the continent and for outside investors. Africa&rsquo;s impressive urban growth opens a range of possibilities, the first of which involves tackling its uneven development with technological innovation. Again, the smartphone is vital here. Local telecom operators such as the MTN Group of South Africa and France&rsquo;s Orange are now selling smartphones for as little as $20 that use a lightweight operating system called KaiOS. Made of cheap plastic and using an operating system designed for the slower 3G networks that cover large parts of the continent, these phones allow Africans to jump right into the digital economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And to return to the matter of bank accounts, an over-reliance on cash and an under-developed finance sector in many countries mean millions do not have access to banks. With the explosion of smartphones, however, people are able to move away from cash and use their smartphones for digital currencies. Startup companies such as Mama Money in South Africa enable remittance payments over cell phone networks. With Mama Money, Zimbabwean migrant workers can send money home for a fraction of the cost of normal remittance services and smartphone users can keep the money in a secure digital form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The knock-on effects of &ldquo;banking&rdquo; on smartphones are profound. With digital currencies, many people are able to sign up for health insurance, savings plans and other types of products and services. As urban growth explodes and internet infrastructure improves, these developments will accelerate dramatically. While it won&rsquo;t solve poverty or lack of housing, the smartphone-powered transformation will enable an entirely new class of customers to emerge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who is going to tap this potential? China has already made an aggressive push into several African markets. Through its policy of debt-trap diplomacy &ndash; extending massive credit and extracting political and/or economic concessions when the debtor can&rsquo;t pay &ndash; China has secured massive amounts of land and resources across the continent. Chinese technology is also popular; KaiOS, for example, is owned by a Chinese company. But when it comes to investing in Africa&rsquo;s booming cities and the budding knowledge economy on the continent, the Chinese strategy, with its focus on infrastructure and resource extraction, has one big flaw: China has failed to capture the hearts and minds of young Africans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an opportunity for states like the UAE, Singapore and Estonia. They may be small, but they have invested substantially in their own knowledge economies. Given the reach these countries have via their aviation networks and strong economies, they should be on the forefront of Africa&rsquo;s new urban century. Companies such as the UAE&rsquo;s telecom operator, Etisalat, already have footprints in major African markets like Egypt and Nigeria. The next step is to invest in knowledge-based startups and ecosystems that are harnessing the power of African youth in Kigali and Nairobi and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way that Africa is going to craft its own solutions is by partnering with countries that do not harbor neo-imperial agendas or cling to outdated models of thinking. The old idiom is applicable here: value creation over exploitation. Africa needs eager partners who are investing in the future by empowering young people with the technological tools necessary to innovate for the present. As the population moves into cities, these tools will be key to unlocking the continent&rsquo;s true potential and entrepreneurial edge.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638171545.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'aid-has-not-lifted-africa-out-of-poverty-but-technology-will', '', '2021-11-29 13:09:05', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(218, 5, 37, 'Smart City and Artificial Intelligence: How the UAE and Africa Can Benefit Each Other', NULL, NULL, '<p>What, precisely, is a &ldquo;smart city&rdquo;? The term is overused and much abused. Yet, the concept is something actually quite useful. Smart cities use technology to improve the urban environment. A smart city, essentially, is one that involves smart governance &ndash; another increasingly popular yet misunderstood term. In a nutshell, since technology can ease the burden of modern life by reducing bureaucracy and wasted resources (including time), smart governance in a smart city (or country, for that matter) can assist the critical work of governments. It is that simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that reason, the United Nations is looking for partners with proven, useful expertise &ndash; the hard part &ndash; in smart governance to help set up systems across Africa, an area of the world most in need of ways to &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; the way governments have hitherto worked, in order to deliver on decades of promises largely unfulfilled. And one of the first countries the UN reached out to? The UAE &ndash; which is among the few countries that took to the idea early on, and has built up an impressive capacity in the area. But from this being a one-way street, there is immense benefit involved for the Emirates as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the streamlining of city offices to the automation of mundane tasks such as scheduling rubbish collection, technology is being deployed to make governments function better. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical component in smart city innovations. But the pace of advancements varies massively from one country to the next. For one thing, deploying the latest technological solution for an urban or national problem costs money and requires officials to be nimble so that the inevitable challenges can be addressed quickly. Many cities, however, still struggle to update vital internet infrastructure, let alone be able to implement the latest smart city platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the UAE is different. Home to people from nearly 200 countries, it also has the world&rsquo;s first ministry of AI. Far from being a PR stunt, the ministry is tasked with serious work, as befits a country that takes AI and smart efficiency seriously. As such, the UAE has been able to fast-track the latest smart developments into everyday processes. The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, as just one of many examples, uses AI to identify system weaknesses and to boost efficiency. The Abu Dhabi police uses big data for better information security. It is also experimenting with predictive policing based on AI to simulate traffic flows and to potentially identify dangerous behavior on the roads. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are test beds for the smart city of the future everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it is no accident that the United Nations Development Program is partnering with the UAE to roll out smart government platforms across Africa. The agreement signed by the two parties outlines general areas of cooperation, including support for future readiness initiatives, achieving sustainable development goals with an emphasis on happiness and quality of life, and building smart government capacities in African countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, skeptics will snigger and cynics will grimace. To be sure, any attempt to improve the lives of millions is no small task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, given its recent history and geographic position, the UAE is an ideal choice for such an operation. At the nexus of East and West, the UAE has long been considered the capital of emerging markets. Emirati companies have broad experience across African economies and Abu Dhabi has an active foreign policy in East Africa, as highlighted by the recent mediation between Ethiopia and Eritrea. UAE airlines such as Emirates account for more flights to the continent than any other airline. Coupled with its smart governance pedigree, the UAE help the UN leverage up its governance goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this is not just about altruism; the UAE stands to gain dramatically from the partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the smart governance and smart city initiatives used in Abu Dhabi and Dubai are imported from the West or from China. With a burgeoning technology ecosystem producing some of the Middle East&rsquo;s most valuable start-ups, the UAE is looking to accelerate its own AI platforms and applications. To achieve this, its technology requires vast amounts of data &ndash; which, as a small country, it doesn&rsquo;t have; but as a large continent, Africa can offer in abundance. Dubai and Abu Dhabi might be great testing grounds, but they lack the depth of data offered by major cities in the United States or China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helping African governments create governance platforms will give the UAE access to up-and-coming markets and a trove of data. This data can be used for AI solutions to specific challenges in the emerging world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, many African start-ups are already attracted to Dubai&rsquo;s technology ecosystem. Given the quality of technology infrastructure and the amount of capital available, startups from around the continent have long looked at Dubai as a major center to drive the technology culture in Africa. With the UAE taking an active role in establishing smart government initiatives on the continent, this position will only grow deeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If emerging markets are going to create their own technology solutions and platforms to counter the power of Western options, partnerships like the one between the UAE, UN and African countries will be critical moving forward.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638171623.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'smart-city-and-artificial-intelligence-how-the-uae-and-africa-can-benefit-each-other', '', '2021-11-29 13:10:24', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Now, a fundamental shift in how the region operates is afoot. As the largest component of their labor force is retrenched, Gulf countries are on the verge of transforming their working population of overwhelmingly foreign staff. This is no bad thing, for it will spur efficiency and, even more importantly, accelerate the adoption of New Economy industries based on knowledge creation and information curation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the notable exception of Saudi Arabia and, to some extent, Oman, Gulf nations have relied heavily on foreign labor to keep up with the demands of the modern economy. The UAE, for example, has long outsourced major sections of its economy to foreign workers. From retail to high-tech and construction, expatriates drive the economy. This has given the UAE one of the world&rsquo;s most diverse populations, comprising nearly 200 nationalities. But on the flip side, just 11.4 percent of residents are Emiratis, giving rise to a certain degree of social and cultural dissonance. With the economic downturn caused by Covid-19, this model is looking outdated and ripe for much-needed reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The global economy increasingly is defined by technology, which in turn has enabled remote working. In the early days of the pandemic, the latter saved the world economy from sudden, near-total paralysis. And while there are still dangers, a full-scale repeat of the Great Depression probably has been averted. Today, some of the world&rsquo;s leading technology companies are telling their employees they can carry on working remotely, post-pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new horizon of possibilities thus is opening up. It is one that the Gulf can take advantage of. With an advanced internet infrastructure and an eagerness to embrace technology as a replacement for the extractive industries, the Gulf &ndash; particularly the UAE &ndash; is perfectly positioned to offer fresh opportunities to businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the shift to remote working means Gulf economies no longer need to be so dependent on workers they must bring in from abroad. They can hire them overseas and leave them there. There are huge savings to be harvested from this. Companies won&rsquo;t need to pay relocation expenses, housing and educational allowances for dependent children and perhaps even health insurance for those hired in countries with nationalized health programs. Salaries would also reflect workers&rsquo; local industry standards, rather than the elevated rates that staff in the Gulf expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, since the start of the pandemic, thousands of jobs have been lost across the Gulf, resulting in foreign workers migrating back to their home countries. Mostly, this has been interpreted as a sign of the Gulf&rsquo;s diminishing economic prospects. However, this enforced reform of the labor market is exactly what&rsquo;s needed to usher in a new economic norm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, these two developments allow Gulf nations to seriously ponder how best to restructure their economic model. Put succinctly, it means employing fewer workers at lower cost-per-staff-member, who are highly enabled by technology in higher-value creating industries, which dovetails neatly with long-stated plans to pivot to the knowledge industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, Dubai already understands this. Following the model pioneered by Estonia, Dubai already allows digital entrepreneurs to register their businesses in the emirate but work from elsewhere. These digital businesses ensure that the UAE remains a hive of technology entrepreneurship without the unnecessary costs of the existing labor model. Meanwhile, startups gain access to a developed market with a low tax burden. Using this model, Estonia has developed one of the most powerful technology sectors in Europe while remaining a small country &ndash; like the UAE &ndash; with few foreign resident workers &ndash; unlike the UAE. Now, in turn, the UAE can be more like Estonia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a knock-on effect here. Automation and artificial intelligence are essential for any budding knowledge economy such as the UAE. Local advances in those fields will help streamline the local workforce and such technological gains can also be exported. The rush of scientific and technological activity from the UAE&rsquo;s research bodies is considerable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, there is a prosaic but no less important rationale to a new economic model. In a desert region that must import almost everything it consumes, looking after a large population of foreigners is not easy. While Gulf countries have made strides in securing food and water supply chains, it is nevertheless a costly business and diverts resources away from more constructive and productive projects, to mention nothing of reducing the impact on the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exodus of foreign workers from the Gulf should not be seen as an omen of economic doom, but rather as a reminder that the New Economy to which the region aspires is necessarily light on human resource. Gulf nations long have professed a desire to become knowledge-based economies. The opportunities that come from the pandemic crisis now encourage reinvigorated reform toward that end.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638171740.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'after-the-pandemic-as-workers-are-retrenched-in-the-gulf-an-opportunity-opens-to-rethink-the-regions-economic-model', '', '2021-11-29 13:12:20', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Still, the country might be saved from disaster if it can eventually benefit from hydrocarbon deposits off its shoreline. But to do that, it must first settle its maritime boundary with Israel &ndash; the key prospects lie in waters disputed by both. The problem, however, is that both sides have taken diametrical positions from which they won&rsquo;t budge. With a stronger economy, Israel can afford to wait out Lebanon. This places Beirut in the unenviable position of eventually conceding its claims or risking even deeper damage to its economy and the welfare of its citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all things to do with Lebanon and Israel, there have been complications right from the start. Both countries still are technically at war, and have been since 1948. Thus, when Lebanese and Israeli officials restarted UN-sponsored and US-backed talks in October last year &ndash; after a hiatus of eight years &ndash; both sides warned against any premature optimism. The skeptics were right; negotiations broke down two months later. Israel&rsquo;s energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, put the blame on Lebanon &ldquo;changing its position regarding the maritime border demarcations seven times.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the center of the current dispute is a small, uninhabited islet called Tekhelet and a line in the map drawn by an official from the US state department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The islet&rsquo;s name is inspired by the dye and color derived from it. Referenced in the Hebrew Bible, the precise hue (believed to be a shade of blue) and source of the dye, however, are lost in the mist of history. Tekhelet the rock outcrop, on the other hand, is visible at a distance of 1 kilometer from the coast of Rosh Hanikra in northern Israel. During talks in 2012, the US mediator, Frederick Hof, proposed a maritime border based on Tekhelet&rsquo;s position, splitting a body of contested waters, amounting to 860 square kilometers, in the proportion 45-55 percent in Lebanon&rsquo;s favor. According to Hof, the demarcation of the contested area would be recognized fully under international law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Hof Line would also cut off Lebanon from an area of 1,800 square kilometers that is currently claimed by Israel and which contains the Karish gas field. Thus, at the latest round of talks, Lebanon insisted that the Hof Line be moved. The disputed area extends along the edge of three of the total 10 blocks that have been divided by Lebanon for licensing, exploration and drilling, including the contentious Block 9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lebanese negotiators say Tekhelet should not have been used as the starting point for the Hof Line. Instead, they contend that the demarcation line should start from Ras Al Naqoura, a town in southern Lebanon close to the border with Israel. They insist this is technically and legally justified, based on studies conducted as far back as 2011, including the findings of the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office. Moving the Hof Line in this manner would bring a further 1,430 square kilometers of sea under Lebanese jurisdiction. It would also place around half of the Karish field under Lebanese control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laury Haytayan, a natural resource governance expert in Beirut, says Lebanon&rsquo;s position is supported by international law and cites the precedent of a 1985 ruling by the International Court of Justice on a dispute between Libya and Malta, which states: &ldquo;the equitableness of an equidistance line depends on whether the precaution is taken of eliminating the disproportionate effect of certain islets, rocks and minor coastal projections.&rdquo; In other words, the Hof Line cannot begin at the islet that is Tekhelet, according to this decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haytayan tells me that negotiations are unlikely to restart until Israel returns with a counterproposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, failure by Lebanon to return to the original definition of the Hof Line would be a &ldquo;recipe for deadlock,&rdquo; says Udi Evental of the Institute for Policy and Strategy at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya. &ldquo;There is no chance Israel is going to accept the new Lebanese maximalist definition of the disputed area, which encroaches into the Israeli gas field, Karish,&rdquo; he tells me. According to Evental, for talks to move forward Lebanon must return to the original terms of the Hof Line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel&rsquo;s position is predicated on the fact that Block 9 isn&rsquo;t a make-or-break matter for it. In fact, public interest in concluding a maritime agreement with Lebanon is low. Israel&rsquo;s economy, full of technology startups, for example, is robust at the best of times, and mature enough that it can withstand the Covid-19 pandemic no worse than other developed countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deadlock over Block 9, however, poses a massive dilemma for Lebanon. In 2019, the year before the Covid-19 pandemic, GDP shrank nearly 7 percent. Last year was without doubt even worse, given the country&rsquo;s dependency on tourism. On a debt-to-GDP basis, Lebanon is one of the most indebted countries in the world. And as a measure of investor confidence in its economy, its entire stock market capitalization, as of April 9, amounted to a tad more than $9 billion &ndash; or about as much as one or two mid-cap US companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lebanon, moreover, is a latecomer to the Eastern Mediterranean hydrocarbon game. Israel discovered gas in the Tamar and Leviathan fields in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Cyprus discovered gas in the Aphrodite field in 2011. Egypt has the 16th largest gas reserves in the world. Even Syria has entered the mix, signing a deal with a Russian energy company in March to begin exploration in waters claimed by Lebanon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officials in Israel are thus puzzled by the stance taken by Lebanon. An agreed, legal maritime border would clear the way for Beirut to license international companies to begin exploration. That much activity, let alone actual drilling and export of hydrocarbons, could pull Lebanon from its economic brink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US has long been seen as the only country capable of brokering a deal. Its interest for doing so would be to undercut the influence of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group &ndash; a more prosperous Lebanon would be less willing to entertain Iran-funded and Hezbollah-initiated activities. The last round of talks crumbled in the waning days of the Trump administration. It remains to be seen if the Biden administration can come up with inducements for Lebanon and Israel to return to negotiations. For now, however, the prospect of an agreement is as elusive as the true tint of the ancient Tekhelet dye.

Cash is king in a recession and sovereign wealth funds have deep pockets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking to the Financial Times in April, a Saudi with access to the royal court confirmed this would be the strategy, saying, &ldquo;Any investor should look at global opportunities &ndash; the lessons learned from 2008, buy undervalued assets&hellip;You will see a lot of acquisitions in the next few weeks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The situation does indeed resemble the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-09. Then, Qatar&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund bought into Credit Suisse in 2008 and increased its holdings as the credit crisis unfolded, effectively bailing out the bank in return for cheaper equity. Qatar also increased its stake that year in Barclays, the troubled British bank, to 12.7 percent. The Kuwait Investment Authority poured $3 billion into Citigroup in 2008 and made more than $1 billion a year later when it sold its stake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not only the Gulf funds who are in a buying mood at the moment. In April, China&rsquo;s central bank, the People&rsquo;s Bank of China, increased its holding in India&rsquo;s biggest mortgage lender, HDFC, to 1 percent. Indian news sources have suggested that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, are also on the hunt for cut-price assets with a combined $600 million to spend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such high-profile investments also act as clear signs of how global economic power has been shifting away from the West over the past two or three decades. Asian and Middle East investors have bought what are considered national treasures. In the UK alone, Qatar owns the Shard building, Harrods and is the majority owner of Canary Wharf Group in London, as well as significant stakes in British Airways&rsquo; holding company and Sainsbury&rsquo;s supermarket chain. Of the 20 soccer clubs in the English Premier League, more than half are owned by foreign investors, mostly from the Middle East or Asia: one is owned by an Emirati group, one by a Saudi prince, one by a Thai billionaire family, two by Russian billionaires and two by Chinese companies. PIF&rsquo;s purchase of Newcastle United will take that total to 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For companies in trouble, these sorts of investments are sorely needed but they are apt to provoke a nationalist backlash with headlines about &ldquo;selling off the crown jewels.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is a case in point: aware that Chinese bargain hunters might become a political issue, India&rsquo;s ministry of commerce issued new regulations in mid-April stipulating that any entity based in or tied to a country that &ldquo;shares a land border with India&rdquo; would require government approval for any investment. The reason for the regulations was to curb &ldquo;opportunistic takeovers of Indian companies due to the current Covid-19 pandemic.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s reaction to Chinese investment illustrates the dilemma faced by states on the receiving end of such investment. In straitened times, companies are desperate for capital from any investor but governments are aware that domestically, selling off national assets does not go down well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For China, which has seen its relationship with various European and North American states deteriorate over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, these nationalist concerns could well stymie attempts to pick up cheap assets around the world. But post-pandemic, investors from other parts of Asia or from the Gulf may well find that few Western governments will turn away the sort of megamoney that can reinvigorate economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gradual shift in relative economic power from west to east will thus continue, accelerated once again by a crisis.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638171920.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'investment-power-is-shifting-east-to-the-gulf-and-asia', '', '2021-11-29 13:15:20', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(222, 5, 38, 'Will ‘Peak Oil’ Mean the Decline of Arabian Gulf Economies?', NULL, NULL, '<p>Since the 1970s, analysts have sounded the alarm over &ldquo;peak oil.&rdquo; This does not mean a depletion of hydrocarbon resources &ndash; in fact, discoveries of new reserves continue to be announced. Rather, it implies a time when oil and gas extraction levels begin to fall as demand declines &ndash; mostly because of the rise of alternative energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Monetary Fund, in a new report, believes that global oil demand will peak around 2041, and then decline. If so, per barrel prices are likely to trend downward too. It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to see that oil&rsquo;s position as the energy source of choice is rapidly being challenged because of climate change worries and the rapid improvement in alternative energy technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IMF&rsquo;s view of peak oil focuses on its effect on major oil-producing countries like those to be found on the shores of the Arabian Gulf. Peak oil could impose a major strain on these nations, the argument goes, given their heavy reliance on hydrocarbon sales. These countries, which built national savings schemes in the form of sovereign wealth funds out of those oil and gas sales, are at risk of spending down their rainy-day funds. There is, thus, an existential crisis just two decades down the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, maybe not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dire warnings over the finances of Gulf states is a well-worn story in the Western press, which has somehow failed to register the decade-long strategy among Gulf economies to shift dependency away from hydrocarbon exports to more sustainable local industries. They are spending their sovereign wealth funds &ndash; now, not 20 years hence &ndash; in order not to need them in the future. If one were to review economic developments in the UAE alone, it is clear that investments in infrastructure, manufacturing and services are starting to pay serious dividends, especially in technology-heavy sectors and even renewable energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAE was quick to recognize the potential disruptive power of the internet, and made two critical decisions to ensure local growth in tech-related sectors. It built a world-class infrastructure and directed government units to embrace technology to streamline governance. From the Smart Dubai plan in 2013 to the creation of the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence in 2017, the country has taken every possible step to foster a genuine knowledge economy that will outlive its reliance on hydrocarbon exports. It is easy to dismiss these actions as mere PR stunts, but the reality of the UAE&rsquo;s tech environment belies this narrative. The top-down initiative from emirate-level and federal-government entities has encouraged follow-on private-sector investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider this, the two largest technology acquisitions in the history of the Middle East involved UAE-based companies. Amazon&rsquo;s acquisition of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://souq.com/\">Souq.com</a>&nbsp;and Uber&rsquo;s purchase of Careem reveal two things: the large size of tech companies in the UAE business ecosystem and their sophistication, as reflected in their attractiveness to global technology giants. This, in turn, is creating a virtuous circle, as more and more tech companies are drawn to the UAE, the new center of gravity of the emerging market world. If you are a tech developer in Uganda or Kazakhstan or Thailand, Dubai is probably a regular stop on your business travels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, after tech, add tourism, healthcare, financial services and so on, and it is clear neither Dubai nor Abu Dhabi is simply an &ldquo;oil-rich Arab state,&rdquo; to use the standard Western press shorthand. Instead, they are new metropolitan centers of economic diversity that are being nurtured to maturity well before peak oil reaches its hump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next door, Saudi Arabia, one of the world&rsquo;s largest producers of oil, is investing substantially in the same manner as the UAE. It has put serious money into knowledge-economy infrastructure and is enabling the new economy with software initiatives such as relaxed rules on entry visas and a more liberal attitude toward social norms. It will take time to get Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s technology ecosystem to the same level as the UAE, chiefly because of the size of the Saudi economy. But by replicating the UAE&rsquo;s steps in building a technology ecosystem, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s leadership is demonstrating that it doesn&rsquo;t intend to waste any time in building the foundation needed to transform the economy. Given the size of the Saudi population and economy, the re-engineering will have an even greater tectonic impact than in the UAE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other nations in the region, including Qatar, are adopting similar steps with varying degrees of urgency. With a local population of just over 300,000, yet one of the world&rsquo;s largest sovereign wealth funds, Qatar is approaching the transition with notably less haste than its neighbors, but similar trends are developing with regard to investment in the new economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The argument that Gulf countries are at risk as the world pivots away from oil &ndash; that they will spend down their national savings &ndash; ignores the work already in train to transition to a new and sustainable economic model. The transformation might be slow in some cases, but it is happening. Maybe the IMF should get its analysts to spend more time in the Gulf, instead of trying to do analysis on the basis of reports in their hometown newspapers.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638171994.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'will-peak-oil-mean-the-decline-of-arabian-gulf-economies', '', '2021-11-29 13:16:34', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Lebanon Politics Impoverishes Lebanese', NULL, NULL, '<p>Three months after the resignation of the government &ndash; a short time by the standards of Lebanese politics &ndash; the Iran-proxy, Islamist group Hezbollah and its allies have managed to cobble together a new cabinet. But the news has failed to end angry protests that precipitated then-prime minister Saad Hariri&rsquo;s resignation. And while Hezbollah hoped that all eyes would be trained on the new cabinet and its unprecedented number of female ministers, what attracted attention, instead, was news that Britain, Colombia and Honduras had placed Hezbollah on their list of terrorist organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The roster of countries that consider Hezbollah a terrorist group has grown steadily and is currently up to 17 countries, including the US and seven other members of the G20, in addition to the EU, the Arab League and the GCC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lebanon is a democracy where the will of the people counts for nothing, and where a mob of politicians organizes vast benefits for itself by playing footsie with an Islamist mafia that inflicts terror abroad and acts like a thug against ordinary Lebanese. Meanwhile, those ordinary Lebanese are steadily being impoverished. (So, what&rsquo;s the definition of a failed state again?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular outrage broke out in September, a month after the currency, the Lebanese pound (LBP), started sliding. Having essentially run out of foreign reserves, the central bank could not keep the LBP pegged to the US dollar. Two exchange rates then emerged: one official, the other on the black market. The Lebanese people saw the value of their wealth take a massive cut. They took to the streets again to protest, forcing the &ldquo;national unity&rdquo; cabinet to resign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protesters demanded an emergency cabinet formed of&nbsp;non-partisan&nbsp;experts. But Hezbollah, the power merchant of Lebanese politics, ignored the protesters, and even sent out its bullies to beat them up. When Hezbollah&rsquo;s opponents in parliament insisted on taking popular demands into consideration, the party and its allies used their slim majority to form a government: a political rookie, Hassan Diab, was called up and he formed a cabinet with ministers representing the Hezbollah-led alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even with the new government, the old problems persist. Indeed, no one wants any change to the status quo. An armed militia unaccountable to the state still runs amok and, as a result, the country&rsquo;s economy remains supported at the margins of life by the remittances of Lebanese who have escaped unemployment for work abroad. (Who would want to start a business &ndash; and build jobs &ndash; with a trigger-happy militia running around?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ghazi Wazni, the new finance minister, said the new government would not try to restore the value of the Lebanese pound to its pre-devaluation level of 1,500 LBP to the dollar. Instead, it would work on stabilizing the currency at the current black-market level of 2,000 LBP to the dollar, which means that Lebanon, under Hezbollah, has officially conceded the loss of one third of the nation&rsquo;s domestic wealth. Even the promised new exchange rate might prove elusive, as the central bank lacks enough reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing good can happen while Hezbollah runs its militia like a parallel army (only, better armed, better provisioned, better almost everything). Economies are fueled by sentiment, and the only sentiments Hezbollah prompts are fear and loathing. (But fear is admittedly more powerful.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not even as if Hezbollah actually has any idea about economics. Its chief, Hassan Nasrallah, has proposed that Lebanon might sell produce to Iraq and solicit investments from China. But, despite the fall of the Lebanese pound, Iraq can still (incredibly) find cheaper potatoes from Egypt and Turkey. As for China, a small, impoverished market like Lebanon does not offer much promise. Besides, China already floods the Lebanese market with its exports and there is little it can do to help Beirut overcome its economic hurdles. And there isn&rsquo;t any more China can gain from Lebanon to entice it to invest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Lebanon&rsquo;s parliament debates the new cabinet&rsquo;s platform on thee way to giving it a vote of &ldquo;confidence,&rdquo; the country&rsquo;s politics will remain irrelevant to its fate. Meanwhile, ordinary Lebanese live in enforced penitence for being citizens of a democracy where the ballot paper is worthless, the currency is plunging in value and where a terrorist organization in thrall to Iran runs everything down to garbage collection (except, it isn&rsquo;t being collected). In this, the third decade of the 21st century, has any polity in the ancient Near East and modern Middle East ever been run so woefully?

(224, 5, 38, 'With Budget Deficits Looming, What Will Gulf Oil Producers Do?', NULL, NULL, '<p>Gulf states understandably are ramping up spending in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. But their income also is in sharp decline as oil prices test lows. They must thus decide how to cover newfound deficits as oil trades in the $20-$35 per barrel range, and natural gas at less than $3 per million BTU. The key question is whether the current situation is secular or is just a short- to medium-term problem. Next, while Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE all have significant financial reserves, these are invested in very different ways. Both these issues will influence how countries finance their needs, and what the implications might be if the global recession persists in the longer term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, Saudi Arabia is in a relatively fair position. It has over $500 billion in reserves, and these are held mostly in short-dated US, European and Japanese treasury bills. Its reserves, therefore, have been mostly unaffected by the turmoil that has visited the global share markets. Hence, it can fund a potential $120 billion to $150 billion annual deficit without difficulty for a few years. In fact, it may even find it possible to continue the oil price war aimed at forcing Russia to cut production and at destroying US shale producers. And should this succeed, it will raise the floor on oil&rsquo;s trading range, to its benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, Abu Dhabi. Even though it has much larger sovereign wealth reserves &mdash; estimated at around a trillion dollars &mdash; than any other Gulf economy, much of this is invested in global equities and real estate. Both these asset classes have taken a serious beating in the last month. In addition, such losses that may have been incurred cannot easily be replenished by oil revenue, given current depressed prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Abu Dhabi has said that projects previously announced will continue. Anecdotal evidence also is that budgets already allocated are unaffected. So, it is likely that it has made a decision to take a hit on a portion of its portfolio, while deferring longer-term decisions to a time when it hopes to see some recovery in asset prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kuwait and Qatar are in a tighter spot. They will need to liquidate assets, and will find it difficult to sell real estate and equities without taking very large losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Qatar faces questions over its &ldquo;pharaonic&rdquo; projects. Its hugely expensive effort to host the 2022 soccer World Cup could be a back breaker in the current circumstance &mdash; with the further threat of an insubstantial boost to tourism numbers from low attendance at the event if a coronavirus-induced recession persists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Doha currently is expanding its gas-producing capacity to 126 million tonnes per year from 77 million tonnes. This is an expensive undertaking and from which it cannot hope to reap profit at the present price of $3 per million BTU for its main markets of China, Japan and South Korea. Qatar must decide whether to continue these projects by selling substantial amounts of its holdings in a very difficult market, or to cut its losses quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If current energy prices persist over the longer term, Saudi Arabia &mdash; the region&rsquo;s biggest economy &mdash; will have to rethink its very substantial development plans. The kingdom is intent on diversifying away from crude oil to tourism, technology, military industries and mining. The thinking has been that its Vision 2030 development program would be in place at least a decade before the dawning of peak oil. To that end, it has plans to spend $500 billion on a tech-focused futuristic city, and $100 billion more on luxury tourist destinations. But if the global recession morphs into world depression, there will be few luxury tourists, and its planned city of the future, with its unproven cashflow, will hold little appeal to world lenders &mdash; especially in what will be a highly conservative lending environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, after all is said and done, the kingdom still must diversify. In the circumstance, it may want to review the long-term plans of its previous oil ministers, Ali Al Naimi and Khalid Al Falih. Saudi Arabia will only be able to grow if it plays up its natural advantage &mdash; being the lowest-cost fossil-fuel extractor. As such, it can put on steroid the previous strategy of growing its number of value-adding industries in advanced chemicals, fertilizers and metal smelting, to limit and eventually eliminate its dependence on crude oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over in the UAE, Dubai may see a resurgence. Indeed, it has traditionally fared well when the rest of the world around it has had problems &mdash; an oasis of calm for a troubled region and its money. And for its part, Abu Dhabi might curtail its funding of large new oil and tight-gas fields. In addition, the two emirates might also begin to seek synergy where they currently operate parallel industries, from airlines to financial services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kuwait also will have to reconsider its huge development of Bubiyan Island and to growing its oil industry to increase production. It may end up becoming more dependent on gas from Iraq, Iran or Qatar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cratering of oil demand caused by Covid-19, joined by the massive glut caused by the price war with Russia, places every Gulf economy in a very difficult position. Those with large sovereign wealth funds have the choice of meeting their looming deficits by either selling investments amid falling prices or cancelling some projects. Either way, there will be an impact in each country. What that will be, precisely, is still taking shape. The only certainty is that it won&rsquo;t be pretty.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638172181.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'with-budget-deficits-looming-what-will-gulf-oil-producers-do', '', '2021-11-29 13:19:41', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(225, 5, 38, 'Why We Should Care About Arabic Poetry', NULL, NULL, '<p>Hundreds of years ago, in the bustling souk known as Ukaz, which sits between Al Taif and Mecca, people from across the Arab world met not just to exchange their wares and coins, but also to exercise their most cherished weapon &ndash; their razor-sharp oratorical skills. At Ukaz, one of the old crossroads of the Arab world, literary and oratory activities converged to resolve tribal disputes, to further philosophical discussions and to do battle in poetry. Good orators used poetry as a medium to comment on social and political issues. And in that marketplace of ideas, choosing the right words and tone was like a currency, where the most skilled of poets were clearly the wealthiest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand the diverse and complex Arab cultures, both past and present, observers must appreciate the tradition of oratory skills, and particularly poetry, woven into the very fabric of society. The mastery of the Arabic language has often determined the contour of events shaping entire societies. Indeed, that mastery is often reflected not only in one&rsquo;s words, but can also come from what one chooses not to say. &ldquo;If you speak the word, it shall own you, and if you don&rsquo;t, you shall own it,&rdquo; goes one old Arabian proverb. Another warns: &ldquo;Beware that your tongue does not cut your throat.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the most effective medium of communication is arguably the visual. But traditionally, graceful and witty oratories by master shaers or poets were the most compelling form of persuasion short of the sword. According to legend, the most impressive poems from Ukaz were reproduced on banners woven with golden threads and hung on the Kaaba in Mecca for a year or more. There was no greater honor for a poet than to have his or her words immortalized in Mecca. The practice also relates to the origin of the name Al Muaallaqat &ndash; which means &ldquo;suspended odes&rdquo; or &ldquo;hanging poems&rdquo; &ndash; the revered collection of seven legendary pre-Islamic poets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From elegies to political and patriotic compositions, to romantic poems of love and anguish, to dark humor capturing the concerns of the time, the wealth of Arab culture and history was on display in its poetry. The tradition is still valued today as a record of important historical events that shape the region. For example, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, the Ruler of Dubai in the UAE, is well-known for composing poems to mark special occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Arabic poetry is in mortal danger. Who among us today can improvise the most eloquent and witty rejoinders in rhyme while cane-dancing? Once, the art form was viewed as the epitome of manliness (today, perhaps less so). And as for the Arabic language itself, it, too, is in decline. And this, despite unending campaigns that urge young Arabs to embrace the language of their ancestors through reading initiatives and competitions, as the nuanced and expressive complexities of Arabic is dethroned by the global domination of the English language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the latest sign of the peril faced by tradition, Al Azi, a traditional poetic art form in the UAE expressing praise, pride and fortitude, was listed last year on Unesco&rsquo;s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. This traditional form of poetry recital, performed by groups without musical instruments, goes back at least 250 years. It consists of rhyming poems based on traditional constructions with the lines sometimes interwoven with memorized poems or improvised ones and proverbs. Rendered often in the form of poems exalting honor and pride, men traditionally would recite and repeat the stanzas to boost the morale of warriors as they prepared for war. More recently, Al Azi was regularly performed at weddings, praising the groom and the tribes attending the gathering. A similar tradition in Oman was designated on the same list in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another traditional form of poetry recognized by Unesco in 2012 was Al Taghrooda, a traditional Bedouin chanted art-form that used to be composed and recited by men traveling on camel through desert areas of the UAE and Oman. Bedouins believed that the chanting would not only entertain the riders, but also kept their animals&rsquo; spirit up during their arduous journeys. These art forms did not just entertain people, but strengthened social bonds and kept the language alive. One of the main reasons this tradition and other forms of poetry recitals are fading &ndash; often only making appearances at heritage festivals &ndash; is that many of the great poets have passed away and no successors have emerged among the younger generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the many challenges &ndash; or perhaps because of them &ndash; there are efforts to keep the art of poetry alive through festivals and TV shows featuring large prizes, such as Abu Dhabi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Million&rsquo;s Poet&rdquo; competition, which celebrates the local Nabati dialect spoken in the Gulf, and &ldquo;The Prince of Poets&rdquo; program, which focuses on classical Arabic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But at the end, is poetry even relevant today? I would argue yes. Any serious cultural observer will know that poetic traditions are not to be scoffed at or belittled. It is one of the best ways to try to organize your thoughts, and with which to produce a clearer and more memorable statement. And who can fail to be impressed by a person who has memorized and can quote lines from the most exquisite poems? Poetry mesmerizes elites and masses alike. It informs, inspires and challenges the listener. In what was perhaps a more sophisticated era, it was once the language of diplomacy. In contrast, you just have to tune in today to any Arabic political show and often what follows is a &ldquo;debate&rdquo; conducted with wild rants fueled by temper and ego &ndash; and sometimes even flying chairs. (Clearly, we need more poetry.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To preserve this pillar of Arabic culture, we must recognize that there is not only a great deal of wisdom in poetry, but joyous celebration as well. Today, we are quick to share the quotes of modern-day figures, often in tweet-sized bites of banality. Instead, why not give this region&rsquo;s oldest and often forgotten poets &ndash; both men and women &ndash; a renewed chance to share their wit, art and legacy?</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638172248.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'why-we-should-care-about-arabic-poetry', '', '2021-11-29 13:20:48', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(226, 5, 38, 'Tunisia’s Unfinished Economic Reforms Put Its Democratic Evolution in Danger', NULL, NULL, '<p>The Tunisian protests and riots earlier this month have too often been framed as signs of a new revolutionary ferment reminiscent of those from 2010-2011. That was the spark that launched the Arab Spring. But this month&rsquo;s protests should not be read as new evidence of revolutionary politics. They were, instead, indicative of a great deal of difficult and still unfinished work in Tunisia&rsquo;s economic reforms that in turn imperil its democratic evolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, the protests did signal lingering instability and socioeconomic discontent. But they differed from those of 2010 in so far as protestors were not seeking to overthrow the government. The unrest was not directed, as previously, at a regime with its decades of one-man rule. Or, for that matter, at a police state that enabled it. And neither did protestors form alliances with influential political groups, such as trade unions, that could have built up a national network of protests amid a more defined political agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, protesters were out to signal their frustration with the government for its failure to deliver on economic equality and the complicated and messy politics of their country&rsquo;s democratic transition. This time, the immediate spark to protests was a new budget that included an increase in some taxes and tariffs on imports. On the back of several years of steadily rising prices, these measures provoked strong reactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, it is important to avoid invoking the narrative of 2010, and instead to frame any political implication these protests may have had in the context of Tunisia&rsquo;s current politics. They took place just before local elections that are due in May, and after eight months of rising tension between President Beji Caid Essebsi and Prime Minister Youssef Chahed. Last summer, Chahed launched an anti-corruption campaign that targeted people close to both leading parties in the governing coalition, Nidaa Tounes and Ennahda. Chahed, originally an ally of Essebsi and a member of Nidaa Tounes (which Essebsi heads), had grown increasingly more independent and was forging his own political alliances, particularly with the powerful Tunisian General Labor Union. This prompted speculation that he was seeking to position himself as a presidential candidate next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chahed&rsquo;s increasing independence is believed not to have pleased Essebsi and his closest ally (and, yet, also perennial rival), Ennahda leader Rached Ghannouchi. The protests were convenient for both men and their parties in that they weakened Chahed. And thus, in the realm of politics, this has been the main outcome of the unrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, however, nothing in that outcome addressed the underlying causes of social tension and the need for deeper economic reforms &ndash; in other words, the real reason the riots occurred in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One important grievance driving social discord, particularly in the interior and south of the country, is the fact that Tunisia remains economically cleaved in half. The governing coalition has perpetuated, rather than challenged, the dominance of an economic elite in the capital and on the coast, with the rest of the country often confined to the informal economy and the trade in contraband. Tunisia&rsquo;s elite class control most private companies, much of the banking system and sit on the board of most public and private institutions. They maintain patronage networks in the ministries of interior, justice and finance, in major political parties, civil society organizations, the media and the judiciary. Finally, the large number and the opacity of business regulations &ndash; and the privileged caste of civil servants, often also from well-to-do regions, who apply them &ndash; serve to reinforce these longstanding networks of patronage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ennahda, despite its traditional role in the political opposition and its support in the south, has sought to integrate these networks rather than challenge them. Meanwhile, a ballooning public-wage bill &ndash; the result of the post-2011 policy of creating civil-service jobs and increasing salaries to buy peace &ndash; accounts for half the budget, limiting what funds are available for development projects and to address the needs of long-neglected regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protests have now died down after mass arrests and concessions by the government. But they should still be heeded as a wake-up call to the country&rsquo;s lingering divisions and socioeconomic fragility. A strategy of buying peace through ad hoc concessions will not address the structural economic divide that limits Tunisia&rsquo;s democratic progress. What Tunisia must focus on are reforms that open the formal economy to newcomers from the interior and the south.

This is a dangerous gamble that will lead to more violent unrest and could derail Tunisia&rsquo;s democratic transition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If, in the next few years, the country fails to open the economy and address the historic neglect of half of the country, neither its political nor its economic transition will find a lasting, stable outcome.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638172334.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'tunisias-unfinished-economic-reforms-put-its-democratic-evolution-in-danger', '', '2021-11-29 13:22:14', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

For out of the cauldron of imperialism and war came the seeds of world-culture formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start with Britain. By 1934, a worldwide financial depression had undermined trade and living standards. Competing ideologies were on the rise, with communism flourishing in Russia and fascism erupting in Germany, Italy and Spain. Another world war was only five years away. But even as it set about rearming, the British government created what would become the archetypal weapon of soft power. The British Committee for Relations with Other Countries was created to build &ldquo;friendly knowledge and understanding between the people of the UK and other countries &hellip; creating opportunities, building connections and engendering trust.&rdquo; Eighty-five years on, we know it as the British Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It isn&rsquo;t alone. Germany has its Goethe-Institut, forging &ldquo;partnerships&hellip;in over 90 countries [to] create enduring trust in Germany.&rdquo; Italy&rsquo;s Dante Alighieri Society works to &ldquo;promote&hellip;Italian language and culture throughout the world&rdquo; and the Institut Fran&ccedil;ais &ldquo;promotes French culture internationally.&rdquo; Joining these in 2004 was the Confucius Institute, whose aim is to promote the Chinese language and China&rsquo;s culture. Plans are to have up to 1,000 Confucius Institutes by next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, these government-funded organizations reach tens of millions of people each year, pursuing the central mission of strengthening their national economies by reinforcing the importance of their respective languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where in the rapidly changing world of the 21st century is the voice of Arabia?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The British Council and others were born in a world defined by European colonialism. Today, the influence of those once great powers is waning and in this new world the growing influence of the Gulf states is undeniable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil wealth has been intelligently exploited to begin diversification away from reliance on fossil fuels. Today, countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE are engaged and invested around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This influence is advancing on all fronts. This month thousands of athletes from 190 countries descended on Abu Dhabi for the Special Olympics World Games, the first held in the region. Next year, the ranks of millions of tourists who already throng to Dubai annually will be swollen by some 25 million visitors to Expo 2020, the first staged in the Arab world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UK, Arabic is now being promoted as one of the most important languages needed to plug a national skills gap estimated by a parliamentary review to be costing 3.5 percent of GDP. A report from the British Council itself lists Arabic as one of five languages the UK needs most. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, meanwhile, regards Arabic as one of a handful of essential languages for its diplomats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arabic is on the cusp of becoming a global language. What better time, then, for it to find its voice in world affairs and carry the educational, cultural and linguistic beacon to the West?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Arab world needs its own &ldquo;British Council&rdquo; to promote the language and reinforce its growing importance. The days have gone &ndash; or should have &ndash; when English-speaking businesspeople could visit the region and expect the locals to speak their language. But this is not about pride. Instead, it is a pragmatic reinforcing of the importance of the Arab world, and word, in the modern era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, institutions like the Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan Center for Arabic Language and Islamic Studies, established in 1994 in Beijing, do exist. Since its founding, the Sheikh Zayed Center has trained over 1,000 students in Arabic. But to maximize its impact, any future globally dispersed &ldquo;Arabic Council&rdquo; should be broadly based. The nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council would make obvious founding partners, but a pan-Arab council would also gain much from the inclusion of nations such as Egypt and Iraq, responsible for many cultural and social developments that have enriched the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern Arabia lacks a true and coherent voice and image in the West, which in turn lacks true understanding of the Arab world, which frequently is portrayed in the Western media in only negative ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This must stop. Misunderstandings about Arabia and Islam have plagued relations between the region and the wider world or decades, with catastrophic consequences. As the Arab world moves front and center, it is no longer enough simply to shrug. Arabia must make its case and what better way to do so than by taking a leaf out of the playbook of the British Council?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The council, seen as a vital weapon in the UK government&rsquo;s armory, has offices in over 100 countries, including three each in Saudi Arabia and the UAE and others throughout the region. Each is focused on the reinforcement of British influence through the promotion of the English language, arts and culture. Last year, worldwide the council reached more than 758 million people, either directly or through online initiatives, broadcasts and publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a 2015 Strategic Defense and Security Review, the UK government pledged it would &ldquo;further enhance our position as the world&rsquo;s leading soft power promoting our values and interests globally with our world-class diplomatic service &hellip; and institutions such as the BBC World Service and the British Council.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gulf can afford to wield such soft power, but it cannot afford not to. When millions come to Dubai next year, at the heart of Expo 2020 they will find the World Majlis, a &ldquo;space for respectful yet inclusive dialogs [that] aims to start a global conversation on topics of great significance for our times.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Majlis is an ancient concept in Arab society, a word loosely synonymous with &ldquo;council&rdquo; but rich with cultural resonance. What better word to hang above the doors of hundreds of &ldquo;Arabic Council&rdquo; buildings around the world, each offering lessons in Arabic alongside social and cultural engagements designed to shine a light on the values of the true Arabia, in the process building cultural and social bridges that the world so badly needs.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638172391.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'the-middle-east-needs-its-own-soft-power-institution-like-the-british-council', '', '2021-11-29 13:23:11', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(228, 5, 38, 'Brexit Britain Should Want to Be Like Singapore; to Get there it will First Have to Pass through the Arabian Gulf', NULL, NULL, '<p>This is a tale of two free-trade agreements. The first, between the European Union and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, has languished unsuccessfully in limbo, being periodically negotiated for 20 years, with no resolution in sight. The second, between Singapore and the GCC, concluded in 2013, is the first free-trade agreement signed by the bloc with a country outside of the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Britain leaves the European Union &ndash; whether it is at the end of the month or after a short delay &ndash; it will need to decide what kind of country it wants to be, free of continental constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One model is Singapore, a low-tax, low-regulation beacon of free trade; this indeed is the ideal Brexiteer vision, and the one most likely to come about if the UK exits without a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But becoming like Singapore is fraught with uncertainty. It means more than merely changing the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union. It will mean changing the UK&rsquo;s relationship with itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first test of this new vision will come in the Gulf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain&rsquo;s exit from the EU is usually seen as a chance to do things differently. But in the Gulf, the best the UK can do is more of the same. In some ways, an FTA with the GCC ought to be one of the UK&rsquo;s easiest. Barriers to trade are already low: import tariffs hover around 5 percent, although the GCC-Singapore deal made almost all imports tariff-free, so there is room for improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year after the Brexit referendum, the UK&rsquo;s international trade minister celebrated the fact that British companies exported more than &pound;30 billion in goods and services to the GCC every year, more than exports to China. Since then trade has grown. The UAE and the UK alone have a bilateral trade target of &pound;25 billion by 2020, and the other major economies of the GCC &mdash; Saudi Arabia and Qatar &mdash; are keen to expand their imports from and investments in the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, as GCC countries look to diversify away from hydrocarbons, many will seek to expand their education, healthcare and financial services sectors. These are all sectors in which British services are strong, offering considerable opportunity for further cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What, on the other side, though, does the Gulf want from the UK?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short answer is stability and continuity. At the moment, most of the trade between the two is focused on oil and gas and defense sales. But defense will not be covered by a free-trade agreement and is usually a government-to-government matter, so from the GCC&rsquo;s perspective, the continuity of a good political relationship is key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same applies to stability. Sovereign wealth funds and private citizens are heavily invested in the UK real estate market, so a decline in prices or fluctuations in the exchange rate can have an impact. However, those things are beyond the scope of an FTA. There are also issues like visa-free access, which the GCC has already requested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, what the GCC wants from the UK isn&rsquo;t entirely more trade &mdash; it&rsquo;s less politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sticking points in the EU free-trade negotiations have been mainly over politics: the GCC want to trade with the EU without what it sees as unnecessary interference in GCC states&rsquo; domestic politics, in particular with regard to clauses about human rights. There is mutual suspicion: the EU is suspicious that a current lack of political liberalization also means the GCC doesn&rsquo;t really want economic liberalization either; while the Gulf suspects that EU clauses about human rights are a way to interfere further in domestic affairs in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do a free-trade deal, then, will mean changing how the UK operates, dropping more political issues and focusing on pure trade. That is precisely what the Brexiteers want, and what the GCC prefers. But from the perspective of the UK, it will mean altering the way Britain has negotiated deals for decades; changing its offer to countries over the circumstances of bilateral trade; and, indeed, changing its relationship with itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It remains to be seen whether the Singapore vision is one that commands support in the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore&rsquo;s success has been built on a very specific political and social culture, one that includes aspects that the British public might favor (such as low taxes and minimal regulation), others that the public definitely won&rsquo;t want (such as low public spending in a country devoted to its deep-pocketed National Health Service), and things that the UK simply cannot copy even if it wanted to (such as Singapore&rsquo;s modest population of five and half million or its broadly cohesive society).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it can do that, it really could be like Singapore, but the Gulf will be the first major test. Conclude a GCC free-trade deal quickly and more complex deals with less willing countries become easier. But fail to pass a deal, or discover that a majority of the country don&rsquo;t want the Brexiteer vision of Singapore-on-Thames, and everything else will become significantly harder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain&rsquo;s Brexit journey to becoming the next Singapore could find itself stuck just east of Suez.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638172488.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'brexit-britain-should-want-to-be-like-singapore-to-get-there-it-will-first-have-to-pass-through-the-arabian-gulf', '', '2021-11-29 13:24:48', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

Instead, when Greeks went to the polls early this month, they discarded the charismatic Tsipras and his leftist Syriza party in favor of the decidedly uncharismatic, technocratic center-right leader of the New Democracy party, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The Harvard-educated former McKinsey consultant was likely more at home delivering a PowerPoint presentation than a rip-roaring speech, but Greeks were in a problem-solving mood looking for solutions to their problem of diminishing incomes, diminishing jobs, diminishing wages and diminishing hope. Maybe a &ldquo;boring technocrat&rdquo; is what they need, after all. That, and the bracing effect of further investments from new partners like those in the Middle East, particularly ones with expertise in real estate and tourism development, such as companies to be found in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greece has experienced a lost decade since the global financial crisis of 2008-9 triggered its own debt crisis. It has lost about a quarter of its economic output, faced debilitating unemployment, stagnant and falling wages, crumbling public services and a major exodus of the best and the brightest. Meanwhile, a nearly $300 billion &ldquo;rescue package&rdquo; put together by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund came laden with demands for austerity and government job cuts. The austerity cycle sent Greece spiraling downward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Tsipras won the premiership in 2015, he faced an unpalatable choice: play ball with the EU and the IMF or go bankrupt. Tsipras was no flame thrower, initial impressions notwithstanding. He chose to play ball, however reluctantly, but he did not inspire business confidence, and the austerity cycle spun onward. The new prime minister, Mitsotakis, has promised deep reforms, tax cuts, job creation and the privatization of services. And whatever he is, he is a man of his word: in 2012, as a minister, he was given the unenviable task of leading EU-mandated job cuts as a result of an earlier bail-out. With little support from political allies, he made the cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when all is said, the fate of Greece should not only be an EU concern. A thriving Greece could boost Arab Mediterranean Sea economies from Morocco to Lebanon. Here is where surplus economies like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates come in. Investments in Greece should be seen as investments in the Mediterranean region. In fact, the Mediterranean-Red Sea-Indian Ocean economic corridor should be considered rightly as one of the Arab world&rsquo;s most vital trade routes, touching countries from North Africa to East Africa to the Arabian Peninsula. In addition, Greece can be an important staging post &ndash; based on the country&rsquo;s local knowledge of the Balkan region &ndash; for Middle East investors planning deeper forays into that part of central and eastern Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, the nearly $500 million MOU signed between Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala, the emirate&rsquo;s second-largest sovereign wealth fund, with Greece&rsquo;s New Economy Development Fund (TANEO) to invest in venture-capital funds that specialize in telecommunications, IT, e-commerce and biotech is a good start. But it&rsquo;s only a start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider what China&rsquo;s COSCO did with the Port of Piraeus. The Chinese firm had been given a lease to run the port more than a decade ago. The flailing port needed a revamp, and COSCO dramatically turned it around, making it the second-largest container terminal in the Mediterranean and, by all accounts, a success story. The COSCO investment shows that there are opportunities for successful investment in Greece, even amid the hardest of times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And along the lines of transportation, Athens might also want to consider vastly expanding the kind of arrangement it already has with Emirates airlines of Dubai. The carrier flies from Dubai to Athens, picks up more passengers, and then flies on to the New York-area airport of Newark, New Jersey, returning on the same route. Expanding on such &ldquo;fifth freedom&rdquo; flights with more Middle East carriers would not just bring more tourists to Greece, but allow it to offer North American travelers the kind of service Middle East airlines are known for. This would constitute a win-win and a win again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, as the economy flickers to life and a new business-friendly prime minister takes the helm, new opportunities abound in infrastructure, services and, of course, tourism (Greece needs more 5-star hotels, for instance). The EU will continue to play a vital role as Greece&rsquo;s backstop and key market, but emerging world countries like China, the UAE and Saudi Arabia should also play a role as commercial partner and investor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Greeks deserve better,&rdquo; Mitsotakis said in his inaugural speech as prime minister, &ldquo;and now is the time for us to prove it.&rdquo; For him to achieve his goal and for Greece to thrive, they will need to attract foreign direct investment far beyond the EU states. As a linchpin of the Mediterranean region, a Greek economic renaissance could benefit a broad swathe of Arab world economies. For that reason, Arab policymakers should see Greece as not just &ldquo;an EU problem,&rdquo; but also a Mediterranean opportunity.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638172567.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'a-greek-economic-renaissance-could-benefit-the-broader-arab-world', '', '2021-11-29 13:26:07', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),
(230, 6, 0, 'New Zealand’s Call to Curb Terrorist Propaganda Puts Tech Companies on Notice that Change Is Coming', NULL, NULL, '<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, landed in Paris this week with a simple message: the terror attack on Muslim worshippers in the city of Christchurch must be a catalyst for big tech companies to change. The attack in March, the worst in New Zealand&rsquo;s history, was live-streamed on Facebook and images and videos of it were widely shared in the hours and days afterwards. Ardern says she saw part of the attack herself when a video of it began playing automatically on her Facebook feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Paris, as co-hosts of a summit on curbing online extremism, Ardern and the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, launched the &ldquo;Christchurch Call,&rdquo; an initiative that aims to make social media giants recognize the real-world harm caused by their virtual platforms. Participants are asked to sign a pledge to crack down more forcibly on the sharing of such terror propaganda and disclose more about how their software identifies and shares such material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the pledge is just the beginning. The sheer reach of companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google has brought them to the attention of &ndash; and into conflict with &ndash; governments around the world, from New Delhi to Moscow to Washington. More than one country has put tech companies on notice that change is coming. But what form it will take is still far from clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, the proposals fall into three categories: technological solutions, addressing policy and public pressure. Tech companies have preferred the first because it allows them, not politicians, to control the process. The Christchurch Call starts with public pressure on media giants to sign up to and abide by a public pledge, hoping that such an open commitment combined with more transparency from the tech giants will bring about the necessary change. However, the pledge is non-binding and while he has given it his full backing, Macron favors much deeper policy change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, France passed a law that allows judges to force the removal of fake news from tech platforms, though it only applies in the three months before an election. President Macron wants to go further, regulating big tech companies in the same way as banks, with regular audits. The UK currently is consulting on new online safety laws that could, in extreme cases, see social media companies hit with large fines or blocked entirely if they don&rsquo;t take sufficient steps to tackle harmful content. Even in the US, the debate is shifting: only last week a co-founder of Facebook explicitly called for the company to be broken up, as other monopolies in the US have been in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taken together, these developments suggest that even in liberal democracies there is exasperation over the lack of regulation of tech companies and a strong desire to force them to make changes &ndash; and not only because of the way they are used to disseminate terrorist propaganda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hate speech has a disproportionate impact on political discourse in democracies and can sway voters. Tech companies have managed to avoid taxation by moving between jurisdictions and they hoover up unimaginable amounts of personal data from citizens of other countries, which ultimately ends up on servers within the United States. These are all strong reasons for governments to target tech companies with legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet any change will be hard to implement because the policies will be hard to formulate. Politicians have been slow to define what hate speech or violent extremist content actually is. Even the Christchurch Call pledge doesn&rsquo;t try, leaving it up to companies to decide what is objectionable material. In places like the US, the line between free speech and hate speech is often a highly politicized judgement. Nor will it be easy to remove terrorists from tech platforms. It may be possible to remove graphic material but differentiating between the militants of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham in Syria planning attacks via WhatsApp and business executives plotting their next business deal in Istanbul is not straightforward. Crafting policy that sets appropriate limits while also maintaining sufficient freedom for users and for tech platforms to innovate will take time, energy and expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a fundamental tension here: governments will only push tech companies to change at a time when public pressure is strong, such as after a violent attack, and that, in turn, is when tech companies will most strongly resist any sudden, sweeping changes in the law. It may also be a moment least conducive to conducting nuanced public discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is more likely, however, that tech companies will have to relent, simply because they are not especially adept at navigating a highly politicized environment. Several major tech companies have already signed up to the Christchurch Call and Facebook&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg flew to Paris last week to discuss plans with Macron (although he did not attend the Christchurch Call summit). Under attack in the US and in Europe, Zuckerberg knows his platform is most in danger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christchurch attack demonstrated once again how online hate, bred and fed online, can suddenly explode into the real world, complete with a live online broadcast that then lives on forever in the dark corners of the internet. Tech companies are being forced to confront the genuine harm that spills over from their virtual world into the real world. The Christchurch Call is part of a broader push from governments, a warning that if tech companies don&rsquo;t change themselves, others will do it for them &ndash; and perhaps very soon.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638172654.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'new-zealands-call-to-curb-terrorist-propaganda-puts-tech-companies-on-notice-that-change-is-coming', '', '2021-11-29 13:27:34', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

This has, unsurprisingly, prompted speculation of China&rsquo;s motives. But the explanations proffered so far by experts betray a palpable lack of sophistication. The crackdown is monumental and potentially paradigm shifting, and will fundamentally redefine what &ldquo;progress&rdquo; in the technology sphere means. Its ramifications will ripple across the global tech community.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/iran-china-strategic-partnership-gamechanger-for-middle-east/\">Middle East</a>&nbsp;economies hoping both to elevate their tech sector and partner with Chinese firms, should take note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent months, the Chinese government has forced several leading companies to make decisions that severely affect their operating models. The most visible example was when Beijing essentially cancelled the IPO of Ant Group and drove its founder, Jack Ma, into hiding for several weeks. The government has also targeted fintech companies and started antitrust inquiries into companies such as Tencent and Baidu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Billions of dollars in market value were lost across the Chinese tech sector in July, as investors tried to make sense of the waves of regulatory pressure. Alibaba, Kuaishou and Tencent (which owns WeChat) &ndash; often called the Chinese versions of Amazon, YouTube and Facebook &ndash; lost $344 billion in market capitalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the surface, it looks like China is dismantling its tech sector. But why would it do such a thing? Isn&rsquo;t China supposed to be world&rsquo;s biggest technology copycat? So why is it taking down successful versions of the West&rsquo;s most successful tech firms?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bloomberg analyst, Noah Smith, thinks it might have something to do with China&rsquo;s military-technology sector. (He isn&rsquo;t alone.) So many resources (including the talent of China&rsquo;s gifted engineers and programmers) have been pouring into the consumer tech sector. Beijing might instead prefer to redirect that talent toward nationalist aims, the thinking goes. In Smith&rsquo;s view, the link between geopolitical power and the consumer internet sector has become &ldquo;too tenuous to keep throwing capital and high-skilled labor&rdquo; at the latter. So, the decision was made to curtail its power and ability to access resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There might be a smidgen of truth to this, but it&rsquo;s too simplistic. Not everything is about war and military strength. Indeed, it is a failing of the West&rsquo;s understanding of China that it views the policy prescriptions of a government that serve the interests of 1.4 billion people through a small number of lenses &ndash; security, economic competition, Taiwan. Such are the limits of its bandwidth that even Tibet is no longer the celebrated cause it once was, having been supplanted by the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In truth, China&rsquo;s consumer tech sector is just starting to make progress in emerging markets around the world. While they still lag behind major US tech companies, Chinese firms have made deep inroads in parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. Given the size and depth of China&rsquo;s technology talent pool, the country should be able to invest in its military needs while allowing profitable companies to develop organically. China can walk and chew gum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A better interpretation of the crackdown might be that the government doesn&rsquo;t see fundamental value in particular segments of the tech sphere that is essentially in the business of keeping people engaged by the lowest common denominator of entertainment. This is still a state controlled by the Communist Party of China, a state that remains deeply torn by the tension between economic advancement and what it sees as frivolous bourgeois distractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications like TikTok create great value for advertisers and big profits for their owners. The algorithms that companies like ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, deploy are immensely powerful. But it is difficult to argue that they serve the advancement of society; more likely, they sap productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not to say that the Chinese government is focused on the intellectual enlightenment of its people. Far from it. China&rsquo;s leadership is interested in power, and these consumer platforms don&rsquo;t seem to be offer much in that department. Instead of investing in more technology focused on cat videos, why not use that talent to further develop, for example, quantum computing? China&rsquo;s leaders don&rsquo;t want to continue to be seen as imitators of the West and have been frustrated that despite its many and significant advances in the pure and applied sciences, the country is continuously derided for a lack of scientific and technological sophistication and imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Beijing does not need to worry about consumer backlash and can divert resources in the technology sector with little or no pushback, it is possible that it will direct resources to the commercialization of scientific advancements made by its university laboratories. In doing so, it will rewrite what has come to be understood as progress in technology, exemplified in the last couple of decades by the likes of Apple, Google and others in Silicon Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ultimately means a rewrite of the playbook of competition. The power of Silicon Valley technology companies is almost unparalleled in history. But if China redefines progress in commercial technology, the rest of the world&rsquo;s tech sector will have to up their game in the face of diminishing returns from 30-second dance videos and shoot-them-up video games, to say nothing of the enabling of disinformation defended as free speech by social media firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As China &ldquo;smashes&rdquo; its technology sector to shift the industry&rsquo;s focus, maybe it&rsquo;s time for a similar reckoning in the rest of the world &ndash; including economies in the Middle East that have lately seen technology as a profitable replacement for their extractive industries.

(232, 6, 0, 'Analysis: Turkish and Israeli Military Tech in the Nagorno-Karabakh War', NULL, NULL, '<p>One thing that wars offer third parties is the opportunity to evaluate weapons employed in real conflicts, as opposed to simulated exhibitions. This is important for tactical as well as procurement reasons. In this regard, the recent war over the territory of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://syndicationbureau.com/en/turkeys-armed-drones-alter-strategic-calculations/\">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>&nbsp;between Armenia and Azerbaijan was notable for three things: the absence of Western-sourced armaments, the continuing effectiveness of generations-old equipment from Russia and the cost-effective potency of weaponry from Turkey and Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From September 27 to November 10, Armenia and Azerbaijan fought an all-out war over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The outcome of the brief, intense conflict was the opposite of the first war between the two, in the early 1990s, in which Armenia emerged the victor. This time, Azeri forces decimated their Armenian opponents on the battlefield and captured large swaths of territory before a Russian-backed truce brought the fighting to a halt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been plenty of ink spilled on the advanced weaponry that drove Azerbaijan&rsquo;s military victory. In particular, the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drone has been heralded as the weapon that won the war, an assessment that, in large part (though not completely), holds true. Drone strike footage released by Azerbaijan&rsquo;s ministry of defense showed dozens of strikes daily by the TB2&rsquo;s guided MAM-L munitions, systematically destroying Armenian air-defense systems, tanks, artillery and even troop formations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TB2s were not the only Turkish equipment Baku deployed, however. Azerbaijan bought $123 million of armaments from Ankara in the first nine months of 2020, a six-fold increase over last year. Along with previous purchases, this gave Baku an array of Turkish-made armored cars, multiple rocket-launcher systems and guided munitions, most of which were employed in some fashion in the autumn war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advanced Israeli armaments also played a key role. Azerbaijan has purchased as much as $5 billion in Israeli military technology in just over a decade, the majority of it focused on precision-guided munitions and drone technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both proved highly effective in this war: Israeli LORA quasi-ballistic missiles were used for strikes on critical infrastructure in the Armenian rear, while IAI Harop loitering munitions (also known as &ldquo;suicide&rdquo; or &ldquo;kamikaze&rdquo; drones) were employed against armored vehicles and infantry. Perhaps the most impressive of these was the Israeli-made Spike NLOS (non-line of sight) guided missile, which struck targets up to 25 kilometers away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular military flights between Baku and Tel Aviv continued multiple times daily for the duration of the war, highlighting the close nature of military cooperation between the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while the flashy new regional tech stole the show, the crucial role of Russian equipment has been downplayed. Russian-manufactured tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and rocket artillery formed the backbone of Azerbaijan&rsquo;s ground forces, without which none of the gains made would have been possible. Roughly $5 billion of Russian arms purchases between 2008 and 2013 fleshed out the majority of Baku&rsquo;s arsenal, a necessity before the country could consider the qualitative advantages provided by more specialized Turkish and Israeli equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowhere was this more visible than in Azerbaijan&rsquo;s armor. Despite being a nearly half-century old platform, the T-72 main battle tank remains the armored fighting platform of choice for smaller nations without the luxury of developing their own indigenous variants, or the ability to buy Western options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Azerbaijan&rsquo;s T-72 fleet in particular, heavily upgraded with advanced sensor equipment and reactive armor to resist anti-tank munitions, forms nearly the entirety of the Azerbaijan armed forces&rsquo; tank wing. A similar combination of adaptability, affordability and availability underscored the rationale for loading up on Russian BMP infantry fighting vehicles to support ground advances. Air superiority might decide a war, but ground forces bear the responsibility for making gains on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Armenia, meanwhile, had little to show in terms of recent military purchases &ndash; largely the result of simply lacking the oil wealth of Azerbaijan. Worse, Yerevan had spent its scant revenues on systems that played no role in fighting. Armenia&rsquo;s four Su-30 jets, acquired several years ago at a total cost of $130 million, were not even deployed, while its Russian-made Iskander ballistic missiles (another post-2016 acquisition) made their first and only appearance on the last day of the war. Neither appears to have been money well spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lessons here for other regional militaries are stark. The war demonstrates that a qualitative edge, employed effectively, can very much shift the battlefield in an aggressor&rsquo;s favor, even when attacking into long-prepared defensive positions. While many elements of the Armenian military performance could have been improved, the ultimate outcome of this battle likely would have been the same. Prospective arms buyers and military tacticians now have had a demonstration in Karabakh of the effectiveness of weapons from Israel and Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then, there are the drones. One of the upsides of drone usage, especially smaller, comparatively low-cost models, is the paucity of effective countermeasures against them. Consider how even a well-armed state with its own extensive advanced arms industry, Russia, approaches the drone problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Khmeimim, the main Russian airbase in Syria, a complex matrix of integrated air defense is employed to counter even the rudimentary drone threat from nearby Syrian rebel groups. This consists of numerous air defense systems &ndash; Pantsirs, Tor M-2s and S-400s &ndash; alongside electronic warfare equipment, at a total cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. The Bayraktar TB2&rsquo;s cost? A mere $5 million per unit, and the Israeli Harop even less (perhaps half a million dollars at most).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;drone revolution&rdquo; demonstrated in Karabakh through Turkish- and Israeli-supplied Azeri weaponry has perhaps been oversold, but in many ways it is very real, and bears lessons that cannot be ignored. While drones will never take and hold territory, something a modern ground force will always be necessary for, Ankara and Tel Aviv now have a formidable showcase of what their technology is capable of, which others in the region should want to pay attention to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Military affairs are a constant race between technological advancements in offensive and defensive technology, and the former, as the recent Karabakh war aptly demonstrated, currently has the upper hand.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638172795.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'analysis-turkish-and-israeli-military-tech-in-the-nagorno-karabakh-war', '', '2021-11-29 13:29:55', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

As economic tensions have risen between China and the United States, forcing allies in Europe to re-evaluate their own ties to China and Huawei, the neutrality long favored by states such as the UAE has become more complicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We see the intersection of geopolitics and technology very clearly, and that has created certain dilemmas for countries like Turkey and those of the GCC,&rdquo; said Mohammadbagher Forough, an expert on China at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Confronted with a geo-economic choice between East and West, a lot of Arab countries &ldquo;are choosing China,&rdquo; he told me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirty years ago, the choice for Gulf states seemed obvious. In 1989, the European Economic Community &ndash; predecessor of the European Union &ndash; established ties with the Gulf Cooperation Council in an agreement billed as the foundation for &ldquo;cooperation on all aspects relevant to bilateral relations.&rdquo; For many in Europe, the goals were clear: to secure energy imports and increase access to Middle East markets. The GCC, meanwhile, viewed the deal as a tool to foster economic development and diversification, and to promote regional integration. Despite early progress, however, an EU-GCC free trade agreement has not materialized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reasons for the failure are varied. Within the GCC, internal disagreements on security and other issues have complicated the bloc&rsquo;s negotiating position, while EU states have faced their own internal resistance. For instance, EU petroleum producers have lobbied hard to derail duty-free access for Gulf states&rsquo; hydrocarbons. More recently, the EU&rsquo;s support for the Iran nuclear deal and the GCC&rsquo;s response to the Arab uprisings have driven the two sides further apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is another factor that cannot be overlooked: the rise of China. In January 2016, Beijing released its so-called &ldquo;Arab Policy Paper,&rdquo; the first time China publicly committed to developing ties with the Arab world. And, unlike the disjointed EU, China is better positioned to deliver on its vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of the new Sino-GCC d&eacute;tente is China&rsquo;s Belt and Road initiative, which seeks to draw on the Gulf&rsquo;s strategic location to fuel a Chinese-centered global network of air, land and maritime trading routes. In the three years since China&rsquo;s Arab policy paper was published, BRI-linked investments to the GCC have skyrocketed. According to Jonathan Fulton, a political science professor at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi and author of &ldquo;China&rsquo;s Relations with the Gulf Monarchies,&rdquo; China&rsquo;s Middle East policy a decade ago was &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; whereas today it is characterized by &ldquo;dense interdependence.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider the numbers. In 2016, trade between the GCC and China hit $114 billion, up from $9.9 billion in 2000. While the EU remains the GCC&rsquo;s largest trading partner, European exports to the GCC have been declining since 2015 while China&rsquo;s have surged. Fulton notes that Sino-GCC trade could hit $350 billion by 2023. Beijing is also increasing military aid to the region. A recent report by the US Defense Intelligence Agency concluded that China is now a top arms supplier to the Middle East, pushing aside American and European arms manufacturers, which are bound by export controls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the EU, these trends mean one thing: Europe&rsquo;s influence in the Middle East is waning. A 2016 assessment for members of the European Parliament warned that China&rsquo;s economic clout &ldquo;is likely to alter regional trade and investment patterns profoundly and to increase competition for the EU in high-end industries it has hitherto dominated.&rdquo; If China and the GCC were to finalize a free-trade agreement, as some experts expect, &ldquo;the EU&rsquo;s prospects of promoting democracy, the rule of law, and human rights in the region&rdquo; would be hurt, the report concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, Europe is not abandoning its relationship with the GCC, or vice versa. In December last year, the EU unveiled plans to open a delegation in Kuwait. And earlier this year, the EU&rsquo;s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, pressed European member states to deepen their role in the Middle East. At an EU-Arab League ministerial meeting in Brussels in February, Mogherini called for a renewal of EU-Arab ties because, as she put it, &ldquo;Europe needs cooperation with the Arab world and the Arab world needs cooperation with Europe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, China&rsquo;s regional forays have made that balance more precarious than ever. Politically, historically and even culturally, the GCC has more in common with China than with the West. For many experts, therefore, the economic realignment is a natural reordering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But tipping too far toward China would be a mistake. For one thing, China&rsquo;s economy is slowing and a recession cannot be ruled out; at least one analyst predicts a decline of annual GDP growth from about 7 percent today to two percent during the next decade. Should such a drop occur, it could devastate China&rsquo;s trading partners. Viewed this way, hitching the cart exclusively to China looks unwise. It also makes decisions like the collective silence from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on China&rsquo;s mistreatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang seem all the more short-sighted (and self-serving).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the best approach, then, is the collaborative model advocated by Al Olama from the UAE: finding ways to work with everyone. While staying neutral and multipolar will not be easy in a world increasingly drawn to isolationism, the alternative would be far costlier.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638172890.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'the-gulfs-sino-european-balancing-act', '', '2021-11-29 13:31:30', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

At face value, the plan looks awfully biased toward the Israelis and prejudicial to the Palestinians. But that is true only if the Palestinians think of land as the end of, and not the means for, a better life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Palestinians and Zionists first locked horns in a fight over territory a century ago, land formed the backbone of their agrarian economies. Since then, globalization has granted an edge in agriculture to countries that encompass large tracts of lands and have abundant water and technology, making local agriculture anywhere else uncompetitive, sometimes even for domestic consumption. Globalization, similarly, consolidated the world&rsquo;s heavy industry in a few countries with big populations, allowing them to engage in economies of scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Israel&rsquo;s once-leading agrarian and industrialized economy has been transformed into one of &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; an economy that depends on human capital and technology rather than on land, population size or natural resources. Israel&rsquo;s drive to control as much as possible of the land of Mandate Palestine is more a luxury than a necessity, one that the Israelis &ndash; with a globally competitive economy &ndash; can afford. The Palestinians cannot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Palestinians, however, the good news is that prosperity is possible without all the land they might think they need or want. All that they require is good governance, freedom of movement globally and within their state, and capital that &ndash; coupled with their abundant human resources &ndash; can turbocharge their economy and improve their lives markedly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such an economic promise is not a consolation prize, but a model that has shown enormous success elsewhere, whether it is the Asian tiger economies like Singapore and Hong Kong, or, closer to home, the Arab emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Trump&rsquo;s vision is scant on details, the map provided in the plan seems to show that Palestinians will control Area A and Area B, as delineated by the Oslo Accords. Together, these two zones total 2,256 square kilometers, or 40 percent of the West Bank&rsquo;s 5,640 square kilometers. This territory houses 2.8 million, or 97 percent, of West Bank Palestinians. The rest of the West Bank, known as Area C, has been contested, and &ndash; in any settlement &ndash; will probably look like a web of intersecting highways and tunnels that will make the proposed Palestinian state contiguous. A Palestinian state will also get the small and densely populated Gaza Strip, where its 369 square kilometers host 1.6 million Palestinians. The state will also home 350,000 Arab Jerusalemites, and also include their neighborhoods in the northeastern parts of the city. As envisaged in the Trump plan, a Palestinian state will probably cover a total area of around 3,000 square kilometers and have a population of close to five million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how does a possible future Palestinian state compare to the Asian tigers? In terms of area, Palestine will be five times as big as Singapore and three times as large as Hong Kong. In terms of population, Singapore&rsquo;s stands at 5.6 million and Hong Kong&rsquo;s at 7.4 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While smaller and much more crowded than a future Palestinian State, Singapore and Hong Kong have GDPs amounting to $340 billion and $350 billion, respectively, compared to the puny GDP of the Palestinian Territories, at less than $15 billion. Even more starkly, the per capita GDP of Singapore, Hong Kong and the Palestinian Territories were, in 2017, respectively, $58,000, $46,000 and $3,100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To sweeten the pot, Trump&rsquo;s Vision for Peace has promised the Palestinians $50 billion. While seemingly generous, this won&rsquo;t be enough to cover the cost of the infrastructure required to make the promised Palestinian state contiguous, and to jumpstart the economy with investments in tourism resorts, high-tech infrastructure and other expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any peace plan should think bigger. Perhaps if the Palestinians were to show a willingness to embrace a state that is small and autonomous, but affluent and well-governed, world governments would step up and open their coffers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe by now Palestinians should realize that land is not more important than the lives of those who live on it. Maybe they should understand that the problem is not who controls the land, but how they control it. Think about it this way: if sovereignty over a large area were a key to prosperity, Lebanon should be rich; instead, Lebanon is broke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palestinians are not totally alien to the benefits of good governance. During his brief, yet successful, tenure from 2007 to 2013, Prime Minister Salam Fayyad delivered to Palestinians what generations of &ldquo;history making&rdquo; leaders could not: the promise of a working economy. A repeat of Fayyad&rsquo;s experiment, on a wider scale and with more global support, might prove to be the elusive peace of mind that Palestinians have been seeking.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638173092.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'trump-peace-plan-for-palestinians-the-promise-of-a-state-should-focus-on-good-governance-and-less-on-land', '', '2021-11-29 13:34:52', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

They have long been victims of ill-informed and outdated agricultural policy, and of woefully inadequate subsidies. Now, farmers also are at the mercy of climate change and the government&rsquo;s inability &ndash; or unwillingness &ndash; to even attempt to combat it. Negotiating between these handicaps is the burden of Turkish farming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A survey of 3,100 farmers carried out last year by the Turkish agri-tech company, Doktar Agriculture, found that 70 percent of farmers were unhappy with the country&rsquo;s agriculture policies. Meanwhile, 79 percent said they struggled daily with the effects of climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rising temperatures and less snowfall point to the increasing likelihood of serious drought. When the average temperature in June last year rose to 23.4 degrees centigrade, a 140-year record, a meteorology professor at Istanbul Technical University, Mikdat Kadioglu, warned that Turkey could be hit by serious water shortages as soon as 2023. The country uses 73 percent of its water resources for farming &ndash; one percentage point more than the global average for irrigation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a luxury the country will not be able to afford,&rdquo; Kadioglu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uncontrolled use of groundwater and unsustainable irrigation techniques have made Turkey &ldquo;water poor,&rdquo; with 60 percent of its land threatened by aridity and erosion. In the last 50 years, two million hectares of wetlands, including 36 lakes, have dried up. Soil calcification and salinity have increased because of bad irrigation practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government-funded Southern Anatolia Project is a prime example of state mismanagement. Encompassing a hydroelectric power plant, forestry areas, irrigation systems and 22 dams, the project was started in 1996 in the Harran plain. Farmers were promised better harvests and higher income. Instead, by 2012, the region had lost 12 percent of its farmland to salinization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After extreme weather devastated more than 1.9 million hectares of farmland in 2018, the head of Turkey&rsquo;s agricultural unions, Semsi Bayraktar, demanded that the government take action against climate change, improve its response to natural disasters and offer better compensation to those affected. Those demands have not been met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, more than $19 billion dollars in state loans to the agriculture sector remained unpaid as of last September, meaning each farmer, on average, owes $8,500 to the government. The precarious financial condition of farmers was starkly on display when, also last year, the agricultural insurance company, Tarsim, paid out five million Turkish liras ($827,000) to 35,626 farmers in the Samsun region for lost harvests as a result of natural disasters such as hail, frost and floods. But those were the farmers who could afford to buy insurance; a further 30,000 could not. By the end of the year, 2,000 farmers in the area had simply given up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a law passed in 2006, an amount equivalent to one percent of the country&rsquo;s gross national product is to be handed out each year to the agricultural sector as subsidies. But bar one year, farmers have not received a single penny. A consequence of this is that three million hectares of farmland are now uncultivated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1980, agriculture employed half of Turkey&rsquo;s population. Ten years later, the number had dropped to 46 percent. Today, it is 17 percent. Data compiled by the Farmer Registration System shows that in the last 10 years, more than 600,000 farmers have quit. Most have taken factory jobs paying minimum wage. &ldquo;The bottom line is, farmers are not being recompensed for their hard work and they feel abandoned,&rdquo; said Berkay Ozyer, manager of Greenpeace&rsquo;s Mediterranean Food and Farming Project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This decrease in farmers&rsquo; numbers often is explained as a sign of the country&rsquo;s industrialization, which, it is argued, has sent rural populations migrating to cities for factory jobs that pay steady incomes under much less harsh conditions than to be found on the land. However, Emin Koramaz, chairman of the country&rsquo;s joint engineers and architects&rsquo; union, points out that, in fact, it is the construction industry that has soaked up labor. The problem with that for workers is that construction jobs aren&rsquo;t long-term. And as for the economy, real estate is not a sustainably productive investment &ndash; once a developer sells an apartment, it mostly ceases to contribute to GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farming remains an important part of Turkey&rsquo;s economy. It constituted 11 percent of exports last year, earning $107 billion over the past five years. Indeed, Turkey remains the world&rsquo;s seventh largest supplier of agricultural produce. Its farmers are the world&rsquo;s largest producers of hazelnuts, figs, apricots and cherries, and the fourth largest harvesters of olives, walnuts and pistachios. But agriculture&rsquo;s share of GDP has decreased to 6 percent in 2019 from 23 percent in 1980. While the sector remains relatively large for now, it is being squeezed by government inattention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the nexus of continents and seas, the agricultural heartland of Turkey is poised at the precipice of climate change, which has affected &ndash; and will further affect &ndash; the finances of farmers and the ability of farm workers to dedicate themselves to the land. Compounding this has been a general neglect of farmers by the government. Farmers need all the support that the law dictates they receive. In fact, probably more. For as climate change continues its advance, we must rely on farmers to keep producing enough food to meet our needs.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638173178.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'turkish-farmers-are-squeezed-by-government-neglect', '', '2021-11-29 13:36:18', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

No, the state of Nevada partnered with the UAE and an Emirati outfit, G42, the company behind the UAE&rsquo;s much touted national testing program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most experts note the importance of large-scale testing to limit the damage of this historic pandemic, which has wreaked havoc across the world.

It may even be surprising to those who do know the UAE, but only as a major oil producer or trade, tourism and logistics hub. In fact, one of the quiet revolutions taking place in the UAE over the past decade has been innovation in science and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then, there&rsquo;s governance. Governments around the world are facing unprecedented challenges to their institutions and leaders. In South Korea, President Moon Jae-In&rsquo;s administration has received high marks for his government&rsquo;s handling of the coronavirus crisis. His ruling Democratic party was rewarded with a landslide victory in a general election this month, winning the kind of majority not seen in more than three decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countries like South Korea and the United Arab Emirates are demonstrating high-levels of competence in handling the crisis. As of April 28, the UAE has recorded 89 deaths from Covid-19 with over 11,000 confirmed infections. For a country as globally connected as the UAE, handling a border-busting pandemic was never going to be an easy task. But the UAE has deployed an array of Fourth Industrial Revolution tools &ndash; artificial intelligence, robotics, 3-D printing, smart technology and genomics &ndash; to go along with traditional large-scale disaster prevention measures and an &ldquo;all-of-government&rdquo; approach to contain the virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geopolitical strategist Joshua Cooper Ramo, writing in his book, &ldquo;The Seventh Sense,&rdquo; notes that &ldquo;we are now in the earliest stages of a shift that promises to be still more consequential than the one that enlightened and industrialized our world over several centuries after the Dark Ages.&rdquo; He points to the power of networks and connectivity as vital to the future of nations, companies and individuals. &ldquo;We experience power through networks now, as once we experienced it through brick-bound institutions such as universities or military headquarters or telephone companies.&rdquo; In short, the more-networked nations will succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAE is one of the most networked places on Earth. Beyond hosting the world&rsquo;s busiest international airport (Dubai International), one of the busiest container terminal ports and one of the most cosmopolitan populations on Earth, UAE companies have wide-ranging connections across the world, benefitting from some of the best experts worldwide, creating virtuous circles of partnership that create breakthroughs. Networks, it must be remembered, are not only about trade routes; they are also about science-sharing routes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevada will not only partner with G42 to set up a testing lab, but also to conduct genomic studies of the virus, according to the Nevada Task Force that announced the partnership. &ldquo;The resources from G42 will substantially increase our ability to conduct Covid-19 testing and research to help us mitigate the effects of this virus on our citizens and visitors during the current crisis,&rdquo; Task Force chair Jim Murren said in a statement. &ldquo;It will also enable us to fortify our ability to provide a safe and sustainable economic recovery for all of Nevada in the long run.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond business partnerships, the UAE has also been on the aid frontlines, supporting other countries in their battle against the coronavirus.

They also tend to concentrate the mind on best practices and solutions rather than the origin of those practices and solutions. Deng Xiaoping famously said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.&rdquo; Governments around the world are finding the essential truth of that maxim.

Regardless of who wins in America&rsquo;s November elections, it is almost inevitable that tension will ratchet up in Washington as China senses the moment, and attempts to take its opportunity, to overtake the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the Chinese economy currently is in no great shape. It was already slowing before the coronavirus crisis, with the trade-war headwinds, a falling working-age population and a massive accumulation of corporate debt. It will further suffer from the slump in its main customers: 20 percent of its exports last year went to North America, 20 percent to Europe, 10 percent to oil exporters. On the other hand, America&rsquo;s dreams of &ldquo;energy dominance&rdquo; have evaporated with the fall in energy prices. It is in any case not clear why the US ever wanted to beef up its role as a supplier of raw materials &ndash; oil, gas and soybeans &ndash; in a contest over the high-tech future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against such somber realities, the Trump administration has been spoiling for a fight to distract November&rsquo;s voters from the White House&rsquo;s failing performance during the coronavirus pandemic. China holds about $1.1 trillion of US government debt and American officials have reportedly discussed cancelling part of it as reparation for pandemic damage; so what has been considered the world&rsquo;s safest financial instrument would immediately become one of its most risky, open now to political interference just like any third world bond. The dollar&rsquo;s dominance would be immediately undermined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other officials posit seizing Chinese assets, as though the US itself has no overseas assets of its own and has never committed offences. Attempts to sanction Chinese firms would make it imperative for Beijing to develop a financial architecture that is not reliant on the US (which, incidentally, would mean the effective end of sanctions against Iran and other states).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>America&rsquo;s demonization of China and Beijing&rsquo;s attempt to usurp America&rsquo;s global leadership raise the specter of globalized chaos in a manner never before possible to anticipate. Superpower confrontation, a weakening of global trade and economic connections, democratic retreat from Washington to Budapest to Ankara, greater poverty and food insecurity and the growing reality of climate damage all make up a recipe for state breakdown and proxy wars in vulnerable countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American military power across the Middle East has been understood to be about protecting its oil and gas supplies and those of its increasingly disillusioned allies against threats including, firstly, the old Soviet Union, then Saddam Hussein, Iran and terrorist groups. Yet the presence of the Fifth Fleet in Bahrain also is a powerful threat to China, a reminder that the US controls the source of 45 percent of its oil imports and 16 percent of its liquefied natural gas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For its part, China has carried out some anti-piracy operations from its base in Djibouti at the southern gates of the Red Sea and has built up Gwadar port in Pakistan, near the Strait of Hormuz. The Chinese military is not (yet) present in Gwadar, and it did not participate in either the US-led or European naval missions in the Gulf. Nor did it mount an independent patrol as Japan, India and South Korea did, following a string of attacks on shipping last year which were blamed on Iran. But as Chinese interests and investments in the Gulf mount, littoral countries may come under growing pressure to choose sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two pipelines &ndash; Russia&rsquo;s East Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline for oil and the Power of Siberia pipeline for gas &ndash;are key parts of diversifying Moscow&rsquo;s exports away from the mature European market. These, along with routes from central Asia, are also a key insurance policy for China against interruptions to sea-lanes. Clearly, China has been thinking strategically and for the long-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In point of fact, China&rsquo;s main response to its hydrocarbon vulnerability has been to seek to dominate the energy industries of the future: solar panels, batteries, electric cars, rare-earth minerals and ultra-high-voltage grids. These are also sources of future economic and environmental advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curiously, it has also stepped up investment in its own oil production, despite high and probably uncommercial costs. In reality, the hydrocarbon potential of the South China Sea is exaggerated. Yet China has intensified harassment of seismic survey ships and rigs operating within the exclusive economic zones of Malaysia and Vietnam, even threatening projects led by the oil champions of the US and Russia, ExxonMobil and Rosneft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beijing&rsquo;s goals here are probably more about control of the sea-lanes and strategic islets than the subsurface resources. This is thus a direct challenge to America&rsquo;s insistence on free navigation rights in the area.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638173508.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'america-must-rise-to-chinas-challenge-but-not-in-the-manner-donald-trump-imagines', '', '2021-11-29 13:41:48', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0);

This means that American policy will incentivize American businesses in strategic sectors like healthcare and technology either to re-home parts of their manufacturing or to relocate them to friendlier countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This presents an opportunity for labor-intensive economies like Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco that are on relatively good terms with America. A steady supply of manufacturing jobs for the high number of unemployed youths in these countries would increase their social and political stability. On the other hand, the increasingly zero-sum nature of economic competition between China and the US means that Middle East countries looking to develop hi-tech industries as part of their economic diversification programs will have to factor in the risks of doing business with China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the Trump administration recently announced sanctions on any company in the world that sells microchips containing or made by American technology to Huawei, the Chinese telecoms company. This will severely affect the plans of several Gulf countries to develop their own indigenous microchip manufacturing capability. If Huawei is the target of US sanctions today, it could be any Chinese company tomorrow &ndash; especially as US policymakers tend to believe that most private companies in China have close ties to the Communist Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Chinese companies are increasingly global leaders in sectors ranging from telecoms and engineering to e-commerce and social media, the inability to partner or do business with these companies will be a severe hindrance to companies in the Gulf and, by extension, to plans to diversify the economies of the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China also is likely to step into the vacuum left by America as it continues to disengage from the Middle East. In the medium term, China will probably not play a military role but, rather, a more significant commercial role: after the pandemic, China is likely to become the single largest country-to-country source of funding for the region&rsquo;s many showpiece infrastructure projects that help prop up the legitimacy of many of the region&rsquo;s ruling elites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese funding will be particularly crucial for the region&rsquo;s governments, particularly as low oil prices put additional stress on many budgets. While China may well offer no-strings-attached financing to those governments, it will exact a political price in the form of quiescence as Beijing sets about refashioning the world order according to its preferences. Middle East governments will have to decide how far they will go toward accepting Chinese suzerainty as part of the emerging&nbsp;<em>Pax Sinica</em>. For example, how long can the regime in Tehran, which prides itself on speaking for all Muslims across the world, stay silent on the treatment of the Uighurs in Xinjiang province without undermining its own domestic legitimacy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The upside to greater Chinese commercial engagement in the Middle East, however, will be that China is likely to persuade the various parties in the region&rsquo;s numerous conflicts to reach some sort of d&eacute;tente or rapprochement. Unlike the US, which is actively involved in those conflicts, China is a neutral party. But it is not a disinterested one. Settling regional conflicts means less potential trouble for Beijing&rsquo;s pet projects, such as the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most significant fallout from US-China tensions will be the Middle East&rsquo;s growing admiration for China&rsquo;s political model. Despite the initial bungled response to Covid-19, China has been relatively successful at containing the virus that causes it. A highly centralized system built around the Communist Party, the ability to place vast populations under lockdown and conduct mass surveillance on its citizens with little or no resistance, a tightly controlled media to spread the desired narrative at home and the mounting of a skilled propaganda exercise abroad through donation of medical equipment &ndash; all are now being carefully watched by many Gulf states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, America&rsquo;s response has exposed the weakness of its political system, with federal and state governments competing for medical equipment and Donald Trump more concerned with the upcoming presidential election than with heeding expert scientific advice. The limits of America&rsquo;s profit-oriented healthcare system also have been laid bare by the pandemic. In addition, the hypocrisy of Trump threatening to use the military to quell civil strife in the US while his administration criticizes Beijing for its heavy-handed response to protests in Hong Kong has also not gone unnoticed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest caveat to these predictions is if the Democrats retake the White House in November. An America led by Joe Biden is likely to pursue multilateralism and restore America&rsquo;s role as upholder of a world order based on global rules. A Biden administration is also likely to re-engage with China and avoid exploiting the relationship with Beijing for political gains at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should this happen, it will lift the cloud of strategic uncertainty that hangs over current interactions between the Middle East and China, and will give the region&rsquo;s leaders a wider choice as they formulate policy.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638173644.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'us-china-tensions-creates-strategic-uncertainty-for-the-middle-east', '', '2021-11-29 13:44:04', '2021-11-29', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

In the hours since Abloh&rsquo;s death at 41, of a rare&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/cancer/\">cancer</a>, was made public, people struggled to characterize a man whose contributions to the industry extended far beyond any individual design. He was variously termed kaleidoscopic, a Renaissance man, a protean force in the history of fashion, and yet, looking back on his brief tenure at the apex of the business, what seems clear is that the word that best describes Abloh was there all along. He had provided it himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abloh was prismatic, a designer capable of capturing the varied colors and lights of an evolving culture, refracting and then beaming them out to a waiting world. Justly heralded as one of the first Black designers to head a European luxury goods house (Olivier Rousteing began his successful run in the top job at Balmain back in 2011), Abloh treated that achievement, if not its accompanying stature, with a seriousness that was impressive in and of itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer was everywhere you looked. Since Abloh&rsquo;s arrival at the label, Vuitton&rsquo;s drab corporate offices on the Right Bank had been transformed into something more closely resembling a communal gathering space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I want all this to mean something,&rdquo; he said then, words that echoed something he had told this reporter just months before he was officially named to his post at Louis Vuitton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On that occasion, in June of 2017, Abloh was a guest designer at the summer edition of Pitti Uomo in Florence. Most designers in that position understandably exploit the unusual platform &mdash; Pitti Uomo is the world&rsquo;s largest menswear trade fair &mdash; to hype their brands. Yet rather than promoting his own Off-White label, Abloh used his stipend to engage artist Jenny Holzer in a collaboration that saw the two of them excerpting fragments of poems by exiles caught up in the global immigration crisis and projecting them onto the walls of the ancient Palazzo Pitti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years later, at the Vuitton studio on the afternoon of my visit, models of varied colors milled around trying on designs for seemingly every permutation of gender. Friends of Abloh&rsquo;s like Kid Cudi and others from overlapping spheres of hip-hop, skating, art and design crowded around a table laden with the absurdly costly accessories that kept most everyone there employed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abloh, whose fingernails were painted gray that day, had just returned to work from what he referred to as a period of rest and reflection &mdash; a break from a punishing schedule that had once kept him on planes at least once a week for years &mdash; and that may in fact have been for the cancer that eventually claimed his life. If anything, he seemed more committed than ever to an expansive view of what constitutes both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fashion/virgil-abloh-fashion-world-grieves-after-death-of-louis-vuitton-star-designer-cancer-news-7646695/\" target=\"_blank\">fashion</a>&nbsp;and its message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Me being here, in this space is about so much more than just making stuff that&rsquo;s cool because it&rsquo;s luxury,&rdquo; Abloh said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet right from the start he created cool &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; in volume, through regularly timed drops and with a maximalist aesthetic that was often far from the sleek refinement of those designers that dominated the upper reaches of menswear when he was on his way up. Whereas seminal late 20th-century designers like Helmut Lang and Jil Sander worked from an aesthetic of crisp, if still sexy, subtraction, Abloh generally favored a pile-on, whether of garments themselves or of references. (At one of his last Vuitton shows, it was coats atop tunics over trousers with hats clamped on hoodies and bags slung around waistlines, across bodies and strapped to backs.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was notably liberal in his samplings from other designers &mdash; to wit: a cloud print collection Italo Zucchelli designed for Calvin Klein in 2014 (and that Drake would later wear on tour) turned up again on a Vuitton fall 2020 runway in pretty close replica &mdash; or uninflected by invisible quotation marks. He mixed with abandon, snagging exoskeleton shapes from Rick Owens&rsquo; tool chest, creating $550 flannel shirts for his cult label Pyrex Vision from logoed Ralph Lauren deadstock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a designer, he was a stealth sentimentalist, someone whose late &rsquo;80s and early &rsquo;90s influences &mdash; whether they were Saturday morning cartoons; or &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo;-era Michael Jackson (in a collection that was pulled by LVMH in response to the &ldquo;Leaving Neverland&rdquo; documentary that detailed allegations against the singer of sexual abuse); or the dewy young Princess Diana, circa her chiffon and pussy-bow period; or the Statue of Liberty as re-imagined as a Sudanese infant; or else the flags of the African continent &mdash; he wore on his sleeve.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638333423.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'virgil-abloh-shocked-the-system', '', '2021-12-01 10:07:03', '2021-12-01', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

As the World-event returns to Spain this winter &ndash; to Carolina Marin&rsquo;s hometown, Huelva &ndash; Nehwal will be missing from the global knockouts for the first time in 12 editions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ravaged by injuries for a large part of the past two years, the 31-year-old&rsquo;s dawdling career has been in free-fall, the plunge now seems starker since she won&rsquo;t be at the Worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eight quarterfinals and two medals &ndash; a silver in 2015 and bronze in 2017 &ndash; from 11 outings might seem like a fulfilling round-off to an accomplished career. But the missing World title will remain the defining crown that eluded Indian badminton&rsquo;s path-breaker, though not from want of effort. In a country starved of top-notch world glory, the consistency of those eight quarters &ndash; starting 2009 through 2018 and two medals &ndash; can appear adequate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/commonwealth-games/pv-sindhu-profile-badminton-biography-stats-medals-cwg-5105924/\">PV Sindhu</a>&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t really allow for any lingering regrets to set in for Indians, nailing the title in 2019 and raking in a world record-equalling five medals. But for the number of years Nehwal endured the rigours of top-grade competition &ndash; she&rsquo;s peerless for staying that fit that long &ndash; the missing World title, will leave a desolation of a vacant trophy shelf.This wistfulness is solely due to what used to be her indestructible mental strength and stubbornness to win, not so much the skill and physical superiority, where Sindhu was always notches above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all that consistency, the World Championships were not the easiest outing for Nehwal. Clearly flummoxed by why she was not medalling in her first seven appearances, she moved cities and coaching centres to hunt down that coveted podium. In the one shot Nehwal got at the crown, Marin was unstoppable, inciting anarchy into her game and shredding the Indian in the second set in Jakarta 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But much before Indonesia, where she had won Tour events when much younger, turned sour, it was the China-saturated labyrinth that brought Nehwal down at the Worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is unthinkable now, given Chinese women&rsquo;s singles shuttlers haven&rsquo;t made the World Championship finals since 2014. But Nehwal started playing at the global event when one country held the monopoly on winning medals at the non-Olympic year Major.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first five of seven defeats Nehwal suffered at the event from 2006-14, came at the hands of Chinese players Jiang Yanjiao (2006), Wang Lin (2009), Wang Shixian (2010), Wang Xin (2011) and Xuerui Li (2013) &ndash; besides Pi Hongyan (2007), the Frenchwoman of Chinese heritage. This was also the era when three of the four semi-finalists at the Worlds would be Chinese: in 2007, 2009 and 2010. In both 2006 and 2011, two of the top four were Chinese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Sindhu broke out onto the World scene in 2013 and 2014 it coincided with China&rsquo;s stock falling at the event &ndash; the towering Indian herself packing off a fair few, sometimes one after another. But China was a diminishing force in women&rsquo;s singles (between them Chen Yufei and He Bingjiao have just three bronzes). Nehwal too had creaking wheels for feet and a bunch of injuries by then. Her best chance was perhaps in 2015, and even that wasn&rsquo;t much of a contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her happiest outing though might be in 2017.

Prince&rsquo;s fight for his place at IIT Bombay and his eventual victory is a David and Goliath tale &mdash; or, perhaps, the story of a modern Eklavya, who got his thumb back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IITs, with their suspicion of reservation and worship of merit, are not known to be friendly to Dalit students. But even processes of admission are loaded against the underprivileged, and internet inequality can become an anti-Dalit pashupadastra. In Prince&rsquo;s case, a portal glitch prevented him from paying the fees. Undeterred, along with his father, a constable, he travelled all the way to IIT Kharagpur, where the JoASS operates. They refused to admit him by accepting the fee a day after the deadline. Prince moved the Bombay High Court, which dismissed his petition. He finally moved the Supreme Court, which responded with sensitivity. Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna ordered JoASS to admit him, reprimanding them for being &ldquo;too wooden&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not an isolated struggle; students from underprivileged sections have to embark on a difficult journey to get admission into the IITs and then survive. Just a few months ago, Vipin P Veetil, an OBC scholar who joined IIT Madras as an assistant professor in general category, was forced to resign because of alleged caste discrimination. Faculty members found out about his caste background and started humiliating and harassing him. The letters he wrote to various authorities reveal how rampant casteism is in these institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reserved candidates&rsquo; struggles do not end with admission. Caste-based discrimination is a continuous problem in many higher educational engineering institutions, where Dalits/OBCs and tribals are treated as the other. Conservative sections have for long opposed the implementation of reservation in faculty recruitment in IITs. Some have demanded the scrapping of reservation entirely. But they do not realise that if such a thing happens, the country will face a bigger protest than the farmers&rsquo; movement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The alumni of several engineering institutions carry caste practices and discrimination from India to the rest of the world. The case of an Indian engineer in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/cisco/\">CISCO</a>&nbsp;and his treatment of his Dalit colleague has become a landmark discrimination case in the United States of<br />\r\nAmerica. Now, the University of California, Davis, has added caste to its anti-discrimination policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prince&rsquo;s struggle is an inspiration for those who continue to struggle in these institutes. First-generation reservation students and later faculty members like me, who go on to work in the higher educational institutions, know how manipulation of last dates, cut-off marks and reservation numbers are done. Once inside as a student, the students are graded and evaluated, not always on objective criteria. After they enter the job market, life is an everyday struggle whether one is incompetent or more competent. Vipin of IIT Madras told me that he faced discrimination for the second reason. He is more competent than a Dalit/OBC faculty member is supposed to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many young boys and girls, first-generation learners from rural India, when faced with such difficulties, tend to give up. Courts like the Bombay High Court treat such cases as acceptable institutional mechanisms. But Prince and his father&rsquo;s determination will serve as an inspirational fable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These institutions can be reformed only by teachers.

But Manet and Gustave Courbet faced insults and punishment for their realistic challenge to the art establishment. Is Faruqui paying for any artistic innovation or rebellion? One must be clear that it is not his comedy or humour that has put him in the line of fire from &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; groups. Some well-intentioned people are trying to present it as that. They are pleading that humour strengthens democracy, that public humour is a sign of a healthy society and so on, and are lamenting that the space for it is shrinking in India. By saying all this, we are trying to turn our eyes from an ugly truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We must accept that it is Munawar Faruqui, a Muslim, who is under attack. For being a Muslim. For the audacity to smile and stand upright. This is the open bullying of a Muslim by the affiliates and fellow travellers of the RSS, with the connivance of the law-and-order apparatus. It is not his jokes that are making &ldquo;Hindus&rdquo; angry. There is no genuine hurt involved here, which can sometimes lead to anger. That can be understood and dealt with. In this case, a cold decision seems to have been made that an example will be made of Faruqui &mdash; and through him, a message sent to all Muslims: They should not expect to live their lives, their way, in India. They are at the mercy of the radicals of the RSS network.The cancellation of Faruqui&rsquo;s show in Bengaluru has another dangerous aspect. This time, it is the police that has taken the lead in forcing the organisers to cancel the programme. The Bengaluru police acted at the behest of &ldquo;many organisations&rdquo;, which in its view were opposed to his show. By doing this, the police legitimised and privileged their view. It also called Faruqui a controversial figure and told the organisers that &ldquo;many states have banned his comedy shows&rdquo;. The police lied. No state in India has banned his shows. It is the threat of violence by organisations like the Bajrang Dal and the refusal of the police to give security that forced the organisers in different states to withdraw. The culprit in all such cases is these violent organisations and the police willing to stand with them and not Faruqui, who is the one being threatened. It is not so complicated for the law-and-order machinery to decide what it has to protect: It has to protect the right to life of the person under attack, and not persecute him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spurious argument is being made that Faruqui has mocked Hindu gods and goddesses and &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; organisations are aggrieved by this. A show not done, jokes not cracked are being imagined and made a reason for action against him. The Indore bench of the MP High Court did not help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faruqui does not do comedy as a hobby. This is his livelihood. By making it impossible for him to use his skills to earn his bread, he is being put in the category of the fruit-seller who would not be allowed in Hindu localities, the mehndiwala Hindu women would not go to, the bangle-seller barred from mixed and Hindu localities and the hotel owner, who would face violence for &ldquo;defiling&rdquo; sacred Hindu land.

Recent results from National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) suggest that we are entering an era where we will have to tackle these challenges. NFHS-5 places the total fertility rate (TFR) at 2.0. With two parents having two children, we have reached a replacement level of fertility. Due to many young people, the population will continue to grow, but the replacement level fertility is a significant milestone in India&rsquo;s demographic history. This decline is spread evenly across the country, with 29 states and UTs having a TFR of 1.9 or less, with seven below 1.6. All southern states have a TFR of 1.7-1.8, similar to that of Sweden. Even states that have not reached replacement fertility &mdash; Bihar and Uttar Pradesh &mdash; seem to be headed in that direction. Between 2015-16 and 2019-20, UP&rsquo;s TFR has declined from 2.7 to 2.4, while Bihar&rsquo;s TFR has declined from 3.4 to 3.0. Part of the original coterie of lagging states, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan both have achieved TFRs of 2.0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This success, however, brings its challenge. As fertility declines, the proportion of the older population grows, and societies face the challenge of supporting an ageing population with a shrinking workforce. This challenge is greater for leaders at the beginning of the demographic transition &mdash; Kerala and Tamil Nadu. According to the National Statistical Office, while the proportion of population greater than age 60 was 8.6 per cent for India as a whole in 2011, it was 12.6 per cent for Kerala and 10.4 per cent for Tamil Nadu, projected to increase further to 20.9 per cent and 18.2 per cent respectively by 2031. Interestingly, these are also among the more prosperous states in India, whose economic activities increasingly rely on migrant labour from other states. With a paucity of data on migration, it is not easy to estimate the dependence on migrant workers, but the Covid crisis and mass return migration of interstate workers suggest that many industries such as auto parts manufacturing and construction in southern states rely on semi-skilled migrants, often transported under contractual arrangements, from northern and eastern states, particularly Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With ageing states increasingly relying on a workforce from relatively younger states to maintain their economic prosperity, it may be time for us to change our mindset about critical dimensions of India&rsquo;s federalism. Concern with population growth and a desire to not reward non-performing states have shaped inter-state relations in India over the past decades, shaping the allocation of political power and central resources devolved to states.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638334372.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'with-indias-demographic-transition-come-challenges', '', '2021-12-01 10:22:52', '2021-12-01', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

The film won many fans for its intricate storytelling and memorable characters played by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/vidya-balan/\">Vidya Balan</a>, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Parambrata Chatterjee. However, it was Bob who gave us nightmares. An insurance agent during the day, he was quite the deadly killer hiding behind the facade of a man on the street. The popularity of the character resulted in many asking for a spin-off for the character and in a rare move, Sujoy Ghosh has written and produced the film with&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/abhishek-bachchan-yes-to-bob-biswas-better-than-kahaani-7641331/\" target=\"_blank\">Bob as the lead character</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob is introduced as a middle-aged man with an unassuming personality who works in an insurance firm but isn&rsquo;t particularly good at his job.

(NASA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On February 16, 1980, India witnessed the first total solar eclipse of the century and this created a great buzz among scientists and skygazers. As a young student, Arvind Paranjpye, now Director of Nehru Planetarium, Mumbai, along with his friends had set out to capture the event. &ldquo;We went to a small village named Shiggaon, situated near the Maharashtra-Karnataka border. Carrying our instruments up to a small hill, we tried to capture the eclipse using polaroid light. We set up a small temporary darkroom and developed the film there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has been an eclipse chaser since then and has seen four other total solar eclipses &ndash; India (1995), Iran (1999), Zambia (2001), and the US (2017). He says each eclipse has its unique charm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On December 4, a total solar eclipse will be visible from Antarctica but Paranjpe will unfortunately miss the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The southern tip of South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand can also see partial phases of the eclipse. It will not be visible from India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked what his favourite moment while seeing an eclipse was, he says: &ldquo;Just before the eclipse you see the shadow of the moon coming towards you at a high speed. If you are on a mountain, you can see from the distant horizon on the west, the shadow approaching you in just four to five seconds. This is an interesting sight but can creep you out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Though I travelled to China in 2009 to witness the total solar eclipse, the area was completely covered by clouds and I experienced a night darker than the darkest nights and was left with a spooky feeling.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He adds that another beautiful phenomenon called shadow bands or wavy lines of moving light and dark can be seen before and after a total solar eclipse. &ldquo;I think the myth associated with snakes and solar eclipses must have originated after people saw shadows moving like snakes and engulfing them,&rdquo; he chuckles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For astrophysicists, solar eclipses provide a rare chance to study the solar corona or the outermost part of the Sun&rsquo;s atmosphere. &ldquo;There are still many unanswered questions about the solar corona. Why does it have such a high temperature of over 5500 degrees Celsius? Most researchers study the Sun&rsquo;s corona in different wavelengths during an eclipse.&rdquo;</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638341224.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'a-night-darker-than-the-darkest-nights-experiences-of-an-eclipse-chaser', '', '2021-12-01 12:17:04', '2021-12-01', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

What goes up, must come down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raj B. Shetty takes that very familiar story about a life steeped in violence and places it in a mythological context, which expands the scope of the film and elevates it to a higher plane.

It becomes more spiritual than a mere act of violence and how it leaves behind a trail of corpses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes it more appealing is that it comes from the benevolent mind of Raj B.

Long ago, the two oceans existed in harmony, with warm and salty Atlantic waters gently flowing into the Arctic. The layered nature of the Arctic &mdash; sea ice on top, cool freshwater in the middle, and warm, salty water at the bottom &mdash; helped hold the boundary between the polar ocean and the warmer Atlantic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But everything changed when the larger ocean began flowing faster than the polar ocean could accommodate, weakening the distinction between the layers and transforming Arctic waters into something closer to the Atlantic. This process, called Atlantification, is part of the reason the Arctic is warming faster than any other ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a new invasion of the Arctic,&rdquo; said Yueng-Djern Lenn, a physical oceanographer at Bangor University in Wales. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s new is that the properties of the Arctic are changing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Satellites offer some of the clearest measurements of changes in the Arctic Ocean and sea ice.

It locked down later than its European neighbors in March 2020, rolled out vaccines faster than almost any major country earlier this year and threw off virtually all restrictions this past summer in an audacious bid to return life to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But with worries about a new variant,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/covid-variant-south-africa-explained-7642199/\">omicron</a>, flaring across the world, Britain has edged back in line with its neighbors in rushing to protect itself. Prime Minister Boris Johnson swiftly banned travel from 10 African countries, made face masks compulsory in shops and on public transportation, and Tuesday greatly accelerated the deployment of vaccine booster shots, hoping to inject every adult by the end of January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain&rsquo;s approach is still significantly looser than countries like Austria, which are back in national lockdowns. People can gather in pubs without masks, for example, and officials keep promising weary Britons a normal Christmas. But Johnson said the government was prepared to stiffen its laissez-faire approach, at least for the moment, to stave off another wave of infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be throwing everything at it,&rdquo; Johnson said at a Downing Street news conference. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking some proportionate precautionary measures while our scientists crack the omicron code.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public health experts welcomed the moves as a recognition that there are limits to Britain&rsquo;s distinctive strategy, which combines a robust vaccination program with an almost total lack of restrictions since July. It showed, they said, that going it alone does not make sense with a fast-moving variant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The U.K. has reacted pretty promptly and basically initiated their Plan B, which many people like myself think they should have initiated a couple of months ago, to put off the threat of the new variant,&rdquo; said Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King&rsquo;s College London. &ldquo;They are bringing the booster forward and making it available to anyone, which I think gives the right message.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the new plan, Britain will expand eligibility for a booster shot to anyone 18 and older; it had previously been restricted to people older than 40. It will shorten the time between shots to three months from six months, drawing on 400 military personnel to help deliver the extra doses. And it will offer a second vaccine shot to children 12 to 18, rather than only to those 16 or older.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government will require all visitors to take a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/\">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;test by the end of their second day after arrival in the country and quarantine until they receive a negative result. But officials brushed aside a call by authorities in Scotland and Wales to impose a mandatory eight-day quarantine on all people who enter the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even without the new variant, Britain has been reporting cases at a rate of more than 40,000 a day. The government has tolerated that high number because 80% of adults are fully vaccinated, which has weakened the link between infections and hospital admissions. About 30% of adults have gotten booster shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the new regulations on travel and face masks bring Britain closer to other European countries, Spector, who leads the Zoe COVID Study, which tracks COVID-19 symptoms, noted that &ldquo;by comparison with other countries, the restrictions are still pretty mild.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also pointed out that Britain was slow out of the gate last week after news of the variant first emerged. It allowed passengers from African nations who landed in Britain to disperse into the country without testing them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has stopped short of ordering people to work from home or mandated vaccine passports or masks in restaurants in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/uk-coronavirus-tracker-region-wise-cases-and-deaths-6373786/\">England</a>. France requires vaccine passports for restaurants. Spain and Italy mandate the wearing of masks in schools. In England, the Department of Education only advised students 12 and older to wear masks in communal areas, beginning Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson declined to advise people to cancel Christmas festivals, Nativity plays or other social gatherings &mdash; parting company with one of his top health advisers, Jenny Harries, who said earlier that people should consider cutting back on socializing during the holiday season to curb potential transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still confident that this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas,&rdquo; Johnson said, alluding to the coal in British stockings last year after the rampaging alpha variant forced the government to impose a lockdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of Britain&rsquo;s strategy still hinges on its faith in vaccines, one of the few bright spots in its otherwise erratic response to the pandemic. Britain&rsquo;s rapid rollout buoyed the Johnson government and gave it the political capital and public health case for easing pandemic restrictions in July &mdash; a policy it has stuck with even as the weather has chilled and cases remained stubbornly high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our strategy is to buy the time we need to assess this variant,&rdquo; the health minister, Sajid Javid, said Tuesday. There are now 13 confirmed cases of the omicron variant in England and nine in Scotland, he said, adding that it was not clear whether the most recent cases were linked to travel from Africa or community transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On London&rsquo;s busy streets, already twinkling with Christmas lights, some said the new rules seemed to be making a difference, after months in which mask-wearing habits had become rather desultory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s wearing masks, and there&rsquo;s a lot more police presence at stations,&rdquo; said Joanne Cairns, 42, a marketing officer who arrived in London on Tuesday from northern England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Matteo Grios, 32, said he found the patchwork of rules confusing. &ldquo;Masks on public transport aren&rsquo;t really going to stop the spread of the virus when you have big events happening at stadiums, or pubs where people get drunk,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson&rsquo;s reluctance to impose sweeping measures reflects pressure from his own Conservative Party. Experts say it is unlikely he would find robust support from restive lawmakers, some of whom flaunt their distaste for such measures by refusing to wear masks in Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the House of Commons voted in favor of the mask mandate and travel restrictions Tuesday, a handful of Conservative lawmakers warned against what they called the government&rsquo;s authoritarian drift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Boris Johnson does face quite a lot of opposition on his backbench,&rdquo; said Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, a London-based research group. She noted that he had alienated members with his handling of issues like a row over Conservative lawmakers who have lucrative second jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, unlike this past spring, when Johnson dragged his heels on imposing a travel ban on India after the emergence of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/covid-delta-variant-coronavirus-cases-7344758/\">delta variant</a>, Britain acted quickly this time. Critics suggest he delayed putting India on a &ldquo;red list&rdquo; back then to avoid antagonizing it at a time when Britain was keen to strike a trade deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The government has been stung by that criticism,&rdquo; Rutter said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some experts chalk up Britain&rsquo;s faster response to simple trial and error, after nearly two years of grappling with the ever-shifting challenges of the pandemic. On masks, for example, officials initially played down their efficacy, then urged people to wear them in confined spaces, before relaxing the guidance again in July.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638344011.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'amid-variant-fears-uk-discovers-limits-to-its-virus-strategy', '', '2021-12-01 13:03:31', '2021-12-01', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

For traversal, you have the iconic, weaponised dune buggy &ndash; Warthog and a UNSC spaceship that lets you engage from higher ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trailer also introduces a female alien-robot hybrid character, who attacks the Master Chief after saying, &ldquo;you are not the future.&rdquo; This could possibly be a fast-paced mini-boss battle.

The incidence of tuition has increased across almost all states &ndash; perhaps a natural response to prolonged school closure. In Uttar Pradesh, 32.9 per cent of students were taking tuition in 2020 which increased to 38.7 per cent in 2021. In Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, there was an increase of 12.7, 12.1, 18.8 and 11.4 per cent, respectively. In Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, the per cent of such students has almost doubled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haryana, as an exception, has emerged as the only state where the tuition dependency has decreased from last year. In Haryana, a total of 37.3 per cent of children were taking tuition in 2020, which dropped to 27.6 per cent in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The probable reason could be the mushrooming of private schools, says Pradeep Kumar Choudhury, Assistant Professor, Zakir Husain Centre for Educational Studies, School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In Haryana, group tuition are more preferred than individual classes.

In the northern and north-western states like Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, private school incidence is relatively high and tuition-taking is low.

And honestly, at this point, I have lost count of how many times they have done the same thing before. Judging by the trailers, I got the impression that the game was just trying to bait nostalgia points and had actually run out of ideas. Which would make sense, considering they are known for somehow churning out a new title every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rightfully so, the longtime fans weren&rsquo;t excited for this one, and neither was I. But having enjoyed a decent amount from their previous iteration, &lsquo;Black Ops Cold War,&rsquo; I decided to jump in with a reasonably open mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Call of Duty: Vanguard review &ndash; Story</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout its marketing campaign, the developers were heavily banking on Vanguard&rsquo;s &ldquo;gripping&rdquo; narrative, that&rsquo;s told in a non-chronological order. Being a fan of disjointed stories, where you have to sort out the puzzle pieces to get a clear picture, I was intrigued by this take. So going in, I was expecting something like Nolan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dunkirk.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most other Call of Duty games, the campaign here isn&rsquo;t quite long, and you can breeze past it in about 5 to 6 hours, depending on what difficulty you choose. Our plot revolves around a group of soldiers, codenamed Vanguard, as we hijack a train to Hamburg, Germany, at the end of World War II. The mission is to find intelligence regarding Project Phoenix, a secret Nazi programme that will ensure the rise of the skinheads even after Hitler&rsquo;s death. As we fight our way through a submarine base, the squad gets captured and taken into questioning by Hermann Freisinger, a fictional successor to the F&uuml;hrer. And from this early point on, the story starts to lose its footing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, the non-linear narrative in this game is flawed. Instead of building suspense with the given characters and set pieces, it prefers to fiddle around with memories. Once our heroes are imprisoned, the game shifts focus from the situation at hand to a series of flashbacks where you play through your team members&rsquo; pasts. The point being, character development for a sequel. The only issue is, as a player, you don&rsquo;t care about them.As part of these sequences, you step into four major war fronts, spread across Europe, the Pacific, and North Africa. The events here are pretty clich&eacute; and follow the generic Call of Duty formula of large-scale dramatic moments and heavy plot armour, sprinkled with a tiny bit of stealth. It&rsquo;s nothing you haven&rsquo;t seen before, and they practically serve as filler content. For the record, this is where 80 per cent of the war or gameplay segments take place. The other 20 is just you sitting inside a cell, waiting for the next cutscene where all the fun and innovative things happen.</p>\r\n', '/assets/newsimagedb/1638346195.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'call-of-duty-vanguard-review-another-generic-wwii-experience', '', '2021-12-01 13:39:55', '2021-12-01', '1', '0', NULL, NULL, 0),

He also pointed out some &ldquo;anomalies&rdquo; in the motion brought by the government Monday for suspension of the members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is wrong to assume that the motion was passed by the House as the entire Opposition was opposed to the motion and, therefore, cannot be the consensus of the House just because of the majority of the ruling party. The members were denied any opportunity to present their case. One of the suspended members was never referred to in the bulletin dated 11 August 2021,&rdquo; Kharge wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was referring to the case of CPI(M) member Elamaram Kareem. His name was not among the 33 MPs mentioned in the bulletin on that day for disorderly conduct.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quoting the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business, Kharge said the action of suspension has to be preceded by the naming of the members under the provisions of Rule 256 (1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kharge also contested the chairman&rsquo;s argument that Rajya Sabha was a continuing institution while defending the suspension of the members for their disorderly conduct in the last session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I wish to state that as per Article 83 of the Constitution, the Council of State is a continuous House unlike the House of People. However, for the functioning of the House, each session is summoned by the President under Article 85 (1) of the Constitution. Thereafter, upon the completion of the sittings for that session, the House is adjourned sine die and subsequently prorogued as per the provisions of Article 85 (2)(a) of the Constitution,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Monsoon Session of Rajya Sabha as summoned by the President on July 2, 2021 concluded on August 11, 2021 and was prorogued by the President on August 31, 2021.
